Reed,<i> &#x201c;fought with bayonets, napalm, and high-tech weaponry of every sort&#x2014;save one. It was not fought with nuclear weapons.&#x201d; </i>With global powers now engaged in cataclysmic encounters, there is no more important time for this essential, epic account of the past half century, the tense years when the world trembled <i>At the Abyss</i>. Written by an author who rose from military officer to administration insider, this is a vivid, unvarnished view of America&#x2019;s fight against Communism, from the end of WWII to the closing of the Strategic Air Command, a work as full of human interest as history, rich characters as bloody conflict.<br><br>Among the unforgettable figures who devised weaponry, dictated policy, or deviously spied and subverted: Whittaker Chambers&#x2014;the translator whose book, <i>Witness</i>, started the hunt for bigger game: Communists in our government; Lavrenti Beria&#x2014;the head of the Soviet nuclear weapons program who apparently killed Joseph Stalin; Col. Ed Hall&#x2014;the leader of America&#x2019;s advanced missile system, whose own brother was a Soviet spy; Adm. James Stockwell&#x2014;the prisoner of war and eventual vice presidential candidate who kept his terrible secret from the Vietnamese for eight long years; Nancy Reagan&#x2014;the &#x201c;Queen of Hearts,&#x201d; who was both loving wife and instigator of palace intrigue in her husband&#x2019;s White House.<br><br>From Eisenhower&#x2019;s decision to beat the Russians at their own game, to the &#x201c;Missile Gap&#x201d; of the Kennedy Era, to Reagan&#x2019;s vow to &#x201c;lean on the Soviets until they go broke&#x201d;&#x2014;all the pivotal events of the period are portrayed in new and stunning detail with information only someone on the front lines and in backrooms could know.<br><br>Yet <i>At the Abyss</i> is more than a riveting and comprehensive recounting. It is a cautionary tale for our time, a revelation of how, &#x201c;those years . . . came to be known as the Cold War, not World War III.&#x201d;</p><p>Thomas Reed is certainly one of the most qualified people alive to tell the real story of the Cold War. He worked at Livermore Labs as early as 1959 and was involved in designing and testing nuclear weapons, he served as Secretary of the Air Force, Director of the National Reconnaissance Office, Assistant to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense, and as a Special Assistant to President Reagan for National Security Policy. Even when he was not directly involved in shaping policy, he was studying and lecturing on the subject. <i>At the Abyss</i> is the result of his remarkable experience, and it is as fascinating as it is terrifying, for he reveals just how close the world came on many occasions to experiencing the horror of global nuclear war. The book is filled with intrigue and revelations as he sheds new light on even relatively well-known events, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis. Here he reveals that as many as 98 nuclear weapons were located in Cuba, not ! just a few as originally thought. He also reports on what transpired during closed meetings at the highest levels of government and how often events threatened to spiral out of control. He details how the information age and "the economic facts of life" eventually doomed the Soviet Union, offers personal reflections on Ron and Nancy Reagan, tells how Dick Cheney and Colin Powell "coaxed the nuclear genie back into the bottle," and how the steadfast "closers," George H. W. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev, calmly and carefully brought the Cold War to a close without bloodshed and chaos---a conclusion that would have seemed inconceivable just a decade before. Even readers well acquainted with Cold War history will find much to learn in these pages. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i><b>Thomas C. Reed</b> is a former Secretary of the Air Force.

She died in 2015.<b>Some Clothes of One&#x2019;s Own</b><br><br> (Published in <i>The New Yorker</i> &#x2013; February 7, 1994)<br> &nbsp;<br> For most of her forty-four years, the designer Miuccia Prada shuddered at the notion of working in fashion. Like lots of people, she thought of fash�ion as basically silly, and as a stupid, superficial way to spend much of one&#x2019;s time. She wanted a life with real meaning. Her family, which owned a Milan leather-goods company, had money, and she was smart and well educated. In keeping with a tradition of socially aware upper-class Italians, she joined the Communist Party in the seventies, while she was attending university in Milan, where she received a doctorate in political science. By her mid-twenties, she had risen in the ranks of the feminist section of the Party, and was spending many of her days demonstrating, leafleting, or confronting local government officials, and her nights debating or giving speeches at meetings. It&#x2019;s funny to think of her now as someone issuing manifestos and holding forth in public, because she&#x2019;s shy, and everything about her resists formulas, including her looks. She&#x2019;s been described as a woman one might find in a painting by Modigliani. Her face veers between beautifully plain and plainly beautiful. She has brown eyes and shoulder-length auburn hair. It wouldn&#x2019;t be true to say that she&#x2019;s slim, or that she&#x2019;s not; she&#x2019;s what old-fashioned doctors used to call &#x201c;the right weight.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Even back when Prada&#x2019;s opinions of fashion were dismissive, she didn&#x2019;t dress like the rest of her crowd. She wore antique dresses, not jeans, and even a few pricier outfits; her favorites were by Yves Saint Laurent. She realized that this way of presenting herself might undercut the idea that she was serious about her politics, but the draw that such clothes had for her was greater than any concern about what others might think. &#x201c;Although I was ashamed of the desire I had for these clothes, I refused to reject this part of myself,&#x201d; she says.<br><br> Perhaps an extra reason that Prada had shuddered at the thought of work�ing in fashion was that such a career had been in the cards for her all along. The family business wasn&#x2019;t just any leather-goods company&#x2014;it was Fratelli Prada, one of the great Milan stores, whose goods had helped establish Ita�ly&#x2019;s reputation for craftsmanship and fine quality since the beginning of the century. In 1958, Miuccia&#x2019;s mother had stepped in as boss at Prada after the death of Mario Prada, the patriarch who created the business, and by the late seventies the question of Miuccia&#x2019;s tie to her heritage could no longer remain up in the air. She&#x2019;d been helping out more and more, liked it, and found herself absorbed in the question of Prada&#x2019;s future. But the decision to work permanently for the firm was difficult, not just because of her take on fash�ion as a world of smoke and mirrors but also because of the political climate in the seventies. &#x201c;Being so involved in the women&#x2019;s movement then, and in everything that it was trying to accomplish, I thought that making bags or shoes or dresses was the worst way I could spend my time,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I was embarrassed, since most fashion had been such a nightmare for women. And I never actually <i>decided </i>to become a designer. Eventually, I found that I was one. I wanted to be something more. But I am what I am. Not everyone can be Albert Schweitzer or Karl Marx.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The fact is that Miuccia Prada has ended up doing more with accesso�ries and with fashion than one might think possible. When she took over, in 1978, the company was in the doldrums, just plugging along. In a way, she has continued what her grandfather Mario Prada began when he established Fratelli Prada, in 1913. But she has done it from a completely different perspective, <br> and with completely different results. Like Miuccia, her grandfather approached his work as though he were an explorer. He made long, arduous journeys all over the world to discover the finest materials for his opulent lug�gage and other luxury items, including some fancy ladies&#x2019; handbags that were the epitome of elegance. Italian leather wasn&#x2019;t good enough for him: He used leather made in Vienna, because it was the best then. In those days, you had to be rich to afford Prada, and in the twenties and thirties Italian aristocrats and European royalty were crazy for the company&#x2019;s products. Classic Prada suitcases of that period were so heavy that you needed servants to carry them. The cases were fabricated from walrus skin, and they included toilet articles made of tortoiseshell, ivory, and gold. Inside, there were as many compart�ments as in a gentleman&#x2019;s dressing room, some of them packed with grooming tools that don&#x2019;t exist anymore. But with the Second World War that way of life disappeared. The family kept the business going by selling goods that were still of high quality but were much more mundane.<br><br> It&#x2019;s anybody&#x2019;s guess what Mario Prada might say if he were alive to see the backpack that his granddaughter created&#x2014;the item that initially put life and prestige back into the business. This bag is so light that when it&#x2019;s empty it feels like nothing. It&#x2019;s black, and very practical-looking, and it doesn&#x2019;t always have a lining. And it&#x2019;s made of a material that has no snob appeal at all: nylon. The backpacks, run up on machines used for making parachutes for the Italian army, initially appeared in the early eighties, and at first it seemed that nobody wanted them. What was hot then was anything that blatantly suggested status and money. Prada&#x2019;s only positive reinforcement came from the fashion vanguard. Mostly she received the kind of advice you often get when you&#x2019;ve done something ahead of its time: People tried to persuade her to add elements that would transform her creation to fit the moment&#x2019;s for�mulas for success. They said she should put initials on the backpacks, the way Gucci does on its bags. She refused. She&#x2019;d hated those initials the whole time she was growing up. After a couple of years, her instinct and conviction paid off. The backpacks and other handheld bags started to attract more and more customers, and then she did add a metal PRADA tag, taken from historic Prada steamer trunks. Women became so attached to the bags, carrying them day and night, everywhere and on every occasion, that they were almost like cult objects. They still are; it&#x2019;s just that now there are more members of the Prada-bag tribe. Constant use was exactly what Prada had in mind: We have so many things to lug around, she believes, that we need something light to carry them in; we go out straight from work, so we have to have something that functions no matter where we are; we can&#x2019;t be worrying that a spill or a splash will lead to ruin; we need something washable, flexible, tough, and soft.<br><br> The bags also caught the eye of the man who became Miuccia&#x2019;s husband and partner, Patrizio Bertelli. She got to know him at a trade fair, where she dis�covered that he was selling bags that looked a lot like the ones she&#x2019;d designed. She hunted him down, pointed out the faults in his versions, and engineered things so that the competition would end up working with her. Soon the team of Prada and Bertelli was running a company that was producing clothes as well as shoes and bags. &#x201c;From the moment we met, we started disputing,&#x201d; she told me, laughing, &#x201c;and we haven&#x2019;t stopped yet.&#x201d; <br><br> Recently, I spent a few days with Miuccia and her husband in Milan, and on the last of them I was partly responsible for a spat between them, because she and I had been talking so long, she&#x2019;d kept him waiting. When we walked into the Prada offices, it was obvious we were in the doghouse. She was about an hour late, and the looks on the faces of the young women running the reception area flashed storm warnings. From the top of the stairwell, Bertelli&#x2019;s voice rained down at us, and, while I couldn&#x2019;t understand the words, their tone was enough to make me want to scram.<br> &nbsp;<br> He didn&#x2019;t give a hoot that his wife had been talking to a reporter. This is not a fellow who spends time trying to seduce the press. &#x201c;Miuccia! Miuccia! You have work to do!&#x201d; he scolded. And, turning to me, the other culprit, he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to kill you later!&#x201d; &#x201c;<i>At </i>or <i>with </i>dinner?&#x201d; I asked, referring to plans we had for that evening. Except for quick smiles, neither Miuccia nor Patrizio allowed my presence to distract them, and therein lies a significant difference between these two and most of the fashion pack. There&#x2019;s none of that faking of harmony, of confidence, or of success, which is constant in the fashion business. With Prada and Bertelli, you don&#x2019;t have to pick your way through the hype. They don&#x2019;t waste energy pretending things for the sake of their public image. <br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s a whole other kind of pretending that keeps the house of Prada moving&#x2014;the dreaming and fantasizing that go on in Miuccia Prada&#x2019;s head. The first time I saw one of her runway shows, a few years ago, a friend whispered, &#x201c;What an incredible interior life that woman must have.&#x201d; These words&#x2014;surprising for a fashion show&#x2014;struck home, because they seemed to pinpoint what was so riveting about what we&#x2019;d seen. The clothes seemed to have something extra to them&#x2014;or, rather, <i>in </i>them. They suggested that someone, not something, had caused them to be. A while later, I started to wear some simple Prada stuff myself: sweaters, shoes, an anorak, one of her black nylon backpacks. Imme�diately, they seemed familiar and intimate. <br> &nbsp;<br> At first glance, some of Prada&#x2019;s work looks plain and undesigned. How it feels on the body is something else altogether; its power remains the wearer&#x2019;s secret. Her ability to give clothes this strong inner quality has to do with her own experience. Her imagination is a huge part of who she is, of how she does her work, and of how she gets through life. She confessed to me, &#x201c;I always live a double life. There is my real life, and then there is the one I would like to live. I am never in my real life only. I am always also in my dreams, or hopes, or thinking about somebody. It&#x2019;s always like this for me.&#x201d; Where her mind travels is often, but not always, reflected in her clothes and accessories. But what can always be discerned in her creations is Miuccia Prada&#x2019;s worldview&#x2014;her view of fashion, her view of women, and even her feelings about the ways the sexes relate to each other. (She recently launched a small line of clothes and accessories for men. Most of them aren&#x2019;t that different from her sporty women&#x2019;s clothes.) Also discernible in anything by Prada is her understanding of materials, of what they can give us&#x2014;or take from us. Many of her creations mix different materials, different textures, different weights, different values, different traditions, different processes, different associations.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since the beginning, with her 1988&#x2013;1989 collection for autumn-winter, her ready-to-wear shows have frequently had a schoolgirl theme. The models have been styled to look like the kind of girls that are considered trouble: the ones who are a bit too bohemian as far as their teachers and parents are concerned, who sleep with a guitar-playing dropout, or who smoke, or spend too much time on art class and not enough on math. The clothes themselves don&#x2019;t necessarily have misfit connotations, and they&#x2019;re not even particularly geared to young women, but, the way Prada imagines them worn, they&#x2019;re like uniforms for the slightly disenfranchised. I asked her if she&#x2019;d been one of those rebellious kids she likes to create on the runway. She said, &#x201c;I tried to be bad, but I couldn&#x2019;t be as bad as I would have liked&#x2014;not as bad as the girls I really admired, and not as bad as the ones who are in my dreams.&#x201d; <br><br> From the outside, Miuccia Prada appears to be what society expects of a woman of her standing. In many ways, she seems the epitome of the good daughter, the good wife, the good mother, the good Italian. She and her hus�band and their children&#x2014;they have two small sons&#x2014;live in the building she grew up in, and her brother and her sister (who went to work at the firm after Miuccia took over), her ex-sister-in-law, her mother, and her aunt all have apartments in the same building. Most Americans would find such an arrangement stifling, but Miuccia&#x2019;s designs prove that roosting at home can be a way of taking flight. She describes her working life as &#x201c;exactly like school,&#x201d; and it&#x2019;s as though out of all this institutionalism she had wrung its opposite: freedom. Her designs have freedom of movement, freedom from definition, freedom from constriction.<br><br> Bohemians, avant-gardists, beatniks have been constant motifs in her designs, but she has also had fun with clothes that signal money and bomb�shell allure. Prada&#x2019;s outfits allow a woman to feel glamorous yet convey the sense that she&#x2019;s playing with glamour&#x2014;she&#x2019;s not owned by it. Prada has done lunch outfits, hostess dresses, ski-bunny ensembles, and twin sets of all types, but in a way that suggests they&#x2019;re part of a movie, not real life. Their colors, including a citrus green that she&#x2019;s particularly fond of, are often as candylike as early Technicolor. Box pleats, bows, snoods, puffs, fashions of the fifties and early sixties, and a memory of the designs of Balenciaga, Courr�ges, and Givenchy are just some of the elements that come into play in these clothes. Her collection for autumn-winter 1991&#x2013;1992 recalled Hollywood heroines&#x2014;especially the kind who went on heists. Some of the outfits seemed made for cat burglars, for roles in the <i>Pink Panther </i>movies, or perhaps for Grace Kelly in <i>To Catch a Thief. </i>The young Audrey Hepburn would have looked fantastic in every single outfit.<br><br> ***<br><br> You can tell what kind of evening Miuccia Prada has had by the shutters in the courtyard of her house in Milan. If she&#x2019;s been smoking and drinking, chances are that the clothes she had on the night before will be hanging outside. And then she&#x2019;ll do everything that&#x2019;s supposed to be healthy, but you don&#x2019;t hear her promising that she&#x2019;s going to give up cigarettes or alco�hol. She says that this outdoor fumigating is the best way to get rid of the smell of her sins, but I think it&#x2019;s also a ritual that reflects her personality. As she points out, she&#x2019;s a &#x201c;Catho-Communist&#x201d;; that is, she has experienced the moralizing of both Catholicism and communism. She uses notions of goodness and badness as if they were the oil and vinegar without which her fashion wouldn&#x2019;t mix into what she wants. And she isn&#x2019;t afraid of living with contradictions and conflicting desires. Rather, she seems to need to express their presence. &#x201c;Everybody makes a choice when he or she gets dressed,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not true when people say, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t care what I have on.&#x2019; Your way of dressing is something you can go to the psychoanalyst to find out about, because there are so many personal things involved. Women, espe�cially, have complexes when it comes to dressing, because of all the atti�tudes toward women&#x2014;about who we are supposed to be, what&#x2019;s supposed to be sexy, and so on. Look at Mrs. Clinton, whom I admire. You can tell exactly what&#x2019;s going on. You can see that she&#x2019;s clever and badly dressed. Maybe she doesn&#x2019;t care, maybe she doesn&#x2019;t understand fashion, maybe she has bad advisers.&#x201d;<br><br> Prada&#x2019;s own solution to the trauma of shopping&#x2014;or a trip to the closet&#x2014;was to return t...</p><h2>Unchosen</h2><p>Bristling with strong opinions and fizzing with wit, Julie Burchill narrates the story of how a chance discovery of her father's copy of a <i>World at War</i> magazine about the holocaust kindled an obsessive love that still sustains her today. <i>Unchosen</i> is not a book for anyone who wants balanced or an even-handed historical account of modern Jewish culture.

The book depicts conversions of a chicken coop, a barn, a mews house, carriage house, firehouse, creamery, icehouse, water tower, powerhouse, an armorer&#39;s workshop, a doll factory, industrial buildings in Paris and San Francisco, a cannery, factories, a bakery, boats and barges, a caboose, a Pullman car, railroad stations, a bank, a schoolhouse, a church and more.</p><p></p><h2>The Crown Jewels</h2><p><p><strong>An extraordinary, newly photographed celebration of this centuries-old collection: England's Crown Jewels.</strong></p> The Crown Jewels have often been called &#x201c;the finest jewelry collection in the world.&#x201d; This book provides a dazzling mix of art and photography with entirely new views plus spectacular details. Individual pieces, gems, and carefully selected groups of objects: the royal jewels can be seen here as never before.<br><br> The priceless objects in the collection were created to be the physical embodiment of English sovereignty, and their story is that of the English monarchy itself&#x2015;from the spoon used to pour out the holy oil of St. Thomas Becket at the coronation to the crown that King Edward VIII took into exile after he abdicated in 1936. In addition to the specially taken photographs of the jewels there are paintings and photographs of monarchs wearing the regalia, coronation ceremonies, and royal events during which items from the collection are used.<br><br> The Crown Jewels are visited at the Tower of London by more than two million people each year. Based on original research and written by an expert in English court history, this is the definitive record of a most remarkable collection. 277 full-color and 19 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Anna Keay was a curator at the Tower of London and now works at English Heritage.

Like today&#39;s America, compromise, complacency, and idolatry had overtaken the nation. Jeremiah&#39;s admonition to them was, &#34;Go stand at the crossroads and look around. Ask for directions to the old road, the tried-and-true road. Then take it&#34; (Jeremiah 6:16 The Message). America desperately needs a generation of pathfinders and trailblazers to arise - change-agents who can lead us back to the old road. Deep within the DNA of every believer is the spirit of Christ, the greatest agent of change the world has ever known, the Pioneer of all pioneers. But His wild nature in us has been tamed in the wilderness of compromise and religion. God is now issuing a fresh and extraordinary invitation to His followers: let me restore to you My son&#39;s untamed, world-changing nature. Have you discovered the wild in you?</p><p></p><h2>The Belly Fat Cure&#x2122; Fast Track: Discover the Ultimate Carb Swap&#x2122; and Drop Up to 14 lbs. the First 14 Days</h2><p><p>&nbsp;</p><b>BELLY BAD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BELLY BEST</b><b>Hidden Sugar = 6g&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ULTIMATE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hidden Sugar = 0g</b><b>High-fructose corn syrup,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CARB SWAP&#x2122;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Real chocolate, no artificial </b><b>processed flour, artificial flavors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sweeteners, all natural (see page 113)</b>&nbsp;For years, fad diets and infomercials have overwhelmed you with unrealistic&#x2014;and often unsafe&#x2014;methods for losing belly fat quickly.

McKillip is the award-winning author of many fine fantasy novels, including World Fantasy Award-winner The Forgotten Beasts of Eld, The Sorceress and the Cygnet, Winter Rose and Song for the Basilisk. She lives in Roxbury, New York.The second novel in Brian Froud's Faerielands series lives up to its subtitle (taken from The Tempest). Megan, a dreamy young artist, resides in a Pacific Northwest coastal village with her pragmatic lover, Jonah, who runs a curio shop. When Megan's drawings of the ocean and its tidal pools begin to take on a life of their own, acquiring such elements as a sea hare that she does not remember executing, she seeks to understand the meaning of these changes. As if in response, Adam Fin, a mysterious artist whose medium is jewelry, arrives in the community. Meagan is drawn to Fin, but Jonah mistrusts him and, for his part, begins to obsess about another mystery, that of a woman singer he hears in a local pub and later encounters as a mermaid in a sea cave. Though warned by a local eccentric, Megan and Jonah pursue their obsessions, with their distinct ties to the sea, until Jonah is lured away and Megan must pay a price to find him. McKillip (The Cygnet and the Firebird) weaves a potent tale, which was inspired by the somewhat frenzied drawings provided by award-winning fantasy illustrator Froud. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Summer Solstice,The</h2><p>From ancient times to the present, people have found many ways to express their thankfulness for the sun's gift of warmth and light.

But what if the country is no longer a democracy at all? In <i>Democracy Incorporated</i>, Sheldon Wolin considers the unthinkable: has America unwittingly morphed into a new and strange kind of political hybrid, one where economic and state powers are conjoined and virtually unbridled? Can the nation check its descent into what the author terms "inverted totalitarianism"?</p><br><br><p>Wolin portrays a country where citizens are politically uninterested and submissive--and where elites are eager to keep them that way. At best the nation has become a "managed democracy" where the public is shepherded, not sovereign. At worst it is a place where corporate power no longer answers to state controls. Wolin makes clear that today's America is in no way morally or politically comparable to totalitarian states like Nazi Germany, yet he warns that unchecked economic power risks verging on total power and has its own unnerving pathologies. Wolin examines the myths and mythmaking that justify today&#x2019;s politics, the quest for an ever-expanding economy, and the perverse attractions of an endless war on terror. He argues passionately that democracy&#x2019;s best hope lies in citizens themselves learning anew to exercise power at the local level.</p><br><br><p><i>Democracy Incorporated</i> is one of the most worrying diagnoses of America&#x2019;s political ills to emerge in decades. It is sure to be a lightning rod for political debate for years to come.</p></p><p><p>"With his fundamental grasp of political theory and restless spirit to get at the essence of what threatens modern democracy, Wolin demonstrates that the threats to our democratic traditions and institutions are not always from outside, but may come from within. It is a book that policymakers and scholars of contemporary society should read and reflect upon."<b>--Rakesh Khurana, Harvard Business School, author of<i>From Higher Aims to Hired Hands</i></b></p><p>"As we've come to expect from Sheldon Wolin, a tightly argued and deeply revealing book about the dangers of unconstrained capitalism for our democracy."<b>--Robert B. Reich, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"For half a century, Sheldon Wolin has been one of the most distinguished and influential political theorists in the United States and a perceptive observer of the American political scene. In his magisterial latest book, Wolin shows himself at the height of his powers as he presents a highly original, sober, and persuasive account of a number of tendencies in contemporary American society that constitute a significant danger for the future of constitutional democracy. If totalitarianism establishes itself in the United States, it will be in the 'inverted' form Wolin analyzes in this important book."<b>--Raymond Geuss, University of Cambridge</b></p><p>"Wolin's writing has a resonance that binds the canon of political philosophy to unfolding events and present circumstances. In<i>Democracy Incorporated</i>, he contends that the institutions and practices that Americans regarded as their defense against totalitarianism--and other forms of authoritarian domination--have failed them. There is nothing like this book. It is a major, potentially revolutionary contribution to political thought."<b>--Anne Norton, author of <i>Leo Strauss and the Politics of American Empire</i></b></p><p>"Powerful and persuasive. <i>Democracy Incorporated</i> does exactly what great political theory should do: it provides a theoretical framework that allows the reader to see the political world anew. It left this reader with an almost nightmarish vision of American politics today, a nightmare all the more terrifying for being so compelling, so vivid, and so real."<b>--Marc Stears, author of<i>Progressives, Pluralists, and the Problems of the State</i></b></p><b>Sheldon S.

Morgenstern classic, <b>The Princess Bride</b>. But as a grown-up he discovered that the boring parts were left out of good old Dad's recitation, and only the "good parts" reached his ears.<br><br>Now Goldman does Dad one better. He's reconstructed the "Good Parts Version" to delight wise kids and wide-eyed grownups everywhere.<br><br>What's it about? Fencing. Fighting. True Love. Strong Hate. Harsh Revenge. A Few Giants. Lots of Bad Men. Lots of Good Men. Five or Six Beautiful Women. Beasties Monstrous and Gentle. Some Swell Escapes and Captures. Death, Lies, Truth, Miracles, and a Little Sex.<br><br>In short, it's about everything.<br><br>Eventually to be adapted for the silver screen, THE PRINCESS BRIDE was originally a beautifully simple, insightfully comic story of what happens when the most beautiful girl in the world marries the handsomest prince in the world--and he turnsout to be a son of a bitch. Guaranteed to entertain both young and old alike by combining scenes of rowsing fantasy with hilarious reality, THE PRINCESS BRIDE secures Goldman's place as a master storyteller.</p><p><i>The Princess Bride</i> is a true fantasy classic. William Goldman describes it as a "good parts version" of "S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure." Morgenstern's original was filled with details of Florinese history, court etiquette, and Mrs. Morgenstern's mostly complimentary views of the text. Much admired by academics, the "Classic Tale" nonetheless obscured what Mr. Goldman feels is a story that has everything: "Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men. Good men. Beautifulest ladies. Snakes. Spiders. Beasts of all natures and descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passion. Miracles." <p> Goldman frames the fairy tale with an "autobiographical" story: his father, who came from Florin, abridged the book as he read it to his son. Now, Goldman is publishing an abridged version, interspersed with comments on the parts he cut out. </p><p> Is <i>The Princess Bride</i> a critique of classics like <i>Ivanhoe</i> and <i>The Three Musketeers</i>, that smother a ripping yarn under elaborate prose? A wry look at the differences between fairy tales and real life? Simply a funny, frenetic adventure? No matter how you read it, you'll put it on your "keeper" shelf. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>Believe it or not, my future husband used this book to win my hand. I think giving it to me as a gift was his way of proving that he is a hopeless romantic, since the book is so wonderfully hopelessly romantic. So far, he's lived up to it!

Now widely considered to be the most important German artist of his generation, Friedrich died in obscurity and wasn&#x2019;t fully appreciated until the early 20th century. An important precursor to the Expressionists, Friedrich once wrote that an artist must "close your bodily eye so that you may see your picture first with the spiritual eye. Then bring to the light of day that which you have seen in the darkness so that it may react upon others from the outside inwards." &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Art series features:<ul> <li>a detailed chronological summary of the life and oeuvre of the artist, covering his or her cultural and historical importance</li> <li>a concise biography</li> <li>approximately 100 illustrations with explanatory captions</li> </ul></p><p>Norbert Wolf graduated in art history, linguistics and medieval studies at the universities of Regensburg and Munich, and earned his PhD in 1983.

Angel, who was sold into prostitution as a child, has learned to distrust all men, who see her only as a way to satisfy their lust. When the virtuous and spiritual-minded Michael Hosea is told by God to marry this "soiled dove," he obeys, despite his misgivings. As Angel learns to love him, she begins to hope again but is soon overwhelmed by fear and returns to her old life. Rivers shines in her ability to weave together spiritual themes and sexual tension in a well-told story, a talent that has propelled her into the spotlight as one of the most popular novelists in the genre of Christian fiction. This is one of her best. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i>Francine Rivers has written over 20 bestselling novels and received numerous awards.

For the first time in her life, she truly understands the meaning of the word &#x201c;charisma.&#x201d; Not knowing that her own destiny is irrevocably tied to his, Anne Kramer listens to the story of Sontime&#x2019;s life.<br><br><i>&#x201c;It began with the magic, you see. And so, perforce, must I.&#x201d; </i>As a boy named Han at the House of Ra, an isolated oasis in the Egyptian desert of a far ancient time, Sontime lived in privilege. There the chosen were trained in the science of alchemy&#x2013;magic, philosophy, miracles. Only two other initiates were as skilled as he: Akan, quiet and studious, a boy whose thirst for knowledge was matched only by his hunger for truth; and Nefar, beautiful and brilliant, a girl as filled with wonder and unfathomable ambition as Han himself. Together they discovered that in union, theirs was a power unmatched in the physical world.<br><br>But even in the House of Ra, there were boundaries to be observed, knowledge that only the masters understood and feared. As the threesome&#x2019;s thirst for answers&#x2013;and for each other&#x2013;deepened, they were tempted by the dark arts that they had sworn to avoid. <i>&#x201c;Look at three magnificent youths who stand astride your world and scoff at the rules you must obey. . . . Look at us, and call us gods.&#x201d; </i>Their power was palpable, their desire total&#x2013;until the fateful moment when their alliance was forever damned, their gifts horribly corrupted.<br><br>A seductive work that seethes with mystery and passion, <i>The Alchemist</i> hurtles readers back through time to an era when magic was sacred and the workings of the world lay in the hands of a few gifted, but tortured souls. In a stunning feat of unbridled imagination, Donna Boyd has created her most hypnotic novel to date.</p><p><b>Donna Boyd</b> lives in a restored turn-of-the-century barn in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains, where she is now working on her next novel.Imagine if you will the days spinning backward: a millennium ends here, a<br>century turns there, a year ends now, and another, and a thousand others,<br>and finally there are so many days, so many years ending and beginning<br>that you can no longer remember why <br>it seemed important that you keep count of them at all. And yet I have<br>counted them. I have counted every one, marking the beginning of each new<br>year, of each new century, in my own quiet fashion: a glass of wine,<br>perhaps, a silent toast. The world revolves, the view changes. Now I stand<br>atop a castle turret, now upon the deck of a sailing ship. Here I gaze<br>upon an ageless river, there a body-strewn battlefield; now I see the<br>dancing lights of the Champs d&#x2019;Elys�e, now I see the smoldering fires of a<br>fallen civilization. The years change, but the question does not. Will<br>this be it? I ask myself. Will this be the year I tell my story, the whole<br>of it, from beginning to end, at last?<br><br>And what a lovely entertainment it has been, all these thousands of<br>turning years, to imagine the telling, the circumstances of the telling,<br>and the reason for the telling. I have created the scenario and variations<br>upon scenario over and over again in my mind. Where to begin? How best to<br>glorify or debase myself in the telling, how to find the thread of truth<br>that, in the end, must be the summation of any man&#x2019;s life&#x2013;even if that<br>life has been as long and as tangled as mine. So now the time has come,<br>and the moment is&#x2013;as so many greatly anticipated moments<br>are&#x2013;disappointing. For I realized some time ago that the whole story<br>cannot be told, not today, perhaps not ever. Every man&#x2019;s life is simply a<br>sum of parts, and these are the only parts I can tell you now.<br><br>But the beginning, where was that? I think sometimes it began with a lithe<br>young girl of grand ambition and laughing eyes. At other times I am sure<br>it all started with the wistful longings of a poet-priest I once called<br>friend. Was it a woman&#x2019;s power, or a man&#x2019;s dreams? What dark god fashioned<br>this unlikely tale and sent it spinning into space with a single smiling<br>breath? And dare I think I ever, at any time, had any control over it at<br>all?<br><br>It began with the magic, you see. And so, perforce, must I.<br>I had a name in that long-ago time, but I have forgotten it centuries<br>since, so let me call myself as I was in those days: Han. Perhaps I had a<br>mother, a father, and an early family life but I do not recall those<br>either. Life began for me, as I remember it, in the House of Ra.<br><br>Much has been written in human history about this time in Egypt; entire<br>lifetimes have been dedicated to piecing together the scattered bones of<br>that long-ago life. As always, when what is shattered is reassembled with<br>no model to follow, mistakes will be made in the reconstruction, great<br>chunks, perhaps, will be missing and others will seem to have no place in<br>the whole at all. The result is, more often than not, a monstrous<br>grotesquerie.<br><br>So believe me when I tell you that, while historians have done a fair job<br>of reassembling the past, so much of what they have learned is only what<br>we wanted them to know, what was left for them to know. And nothing, I<br>assure you, of what you know or what you think you know of that time can<br>even begin to touch the truth of the House of Ra.<br><br>Truth is an interesting word. I cannot tell you now with absolute<br>certainty whether the structure itself, the temple complex in which we<br>lived and worked and ate and slept and studied was in fact composed of<br>mortar and stone, or whether it was merely an illusion of the same&#x2013;or,<br>most likely, a combination of both. I will describe it therefore as I<br>perceived it to be, remembering that in the end, in almost every instance,<br>the difference between truth and illusion is so faint as to be almost<br>inconsequential.<br><br>The House of Ra existed on a man-made oasis far from the banks of the<br>Nile, in a part of the Egyptian desert that is today a particularly brutal<br>and barren stretch of land in a place that is known for its inhospitable<br>nature. Soaring sandstone cliffs surrounded the oasis which, from the sky,<br>would be seen as an island of green in a sea of sand. Date and fig trees<br>grew side by side with banana, papaya, and orange trees. Waterfalls<br>tumbled from limestone boulders, formed deep pools and meandering streams.<br>The ground was covered with a lush low carpet of a fragrant creeping herb<br>that smelled like sweet lavender and felt like moss to the touch. Even<br>after all these years, I can but think of the House of Ra and that<br>fragrance will return to me. There is nothing like it growing in the world<br>today.<br><br>The temple complex was enormous&#x2013;larger, I think, than any of us imagined,<br>for it seemed the more we discovered, the more there was to discover.<br>There was a set of carved cypress doors at the entry to the temple, easily<br>two stories high, which were closed only on ceremonial occasions. The door<br>was inscribed with pictographs in the ancient language centered around the<br>symbol of our craft&#x2013;three interlocked globes in perfect balance that<br>formed the points of a triangle. When the doors were open, the triangle<br>was broken, leaving two globes joined and the one alone. Only when the<br>doors were closed was the triangle complete.<br><br>The complex itself was laid out like a triangle, with long straight<br>corridors containing classrooms, laboratories and sleeping areas, and<br>large circular common rooms at each apex of the triangle. The whole was<br>protected by a raised roof, so that indoor gardens and pools thrived in<br>the artificial tropical rain-forest atmosphere that had been created <br>by the designers. There were many levels, some labyrinthine, some so<br>compact they were practically claustrophobic, each with its own internal<br>environment&#x2013;cool in the heat of the sun and warm when the cold winds blew<br>across the desert.<br><br>Artificial light glowed from the walls and ceilings so that we might work<br>or study at night, and could be discontinued when we wished it.<br>Refrigeration was available, but rarely used, as our supply of fresh foods<br>was abundant. Our clothing was manufactured so quickly and inexpensively<br>that there was no need for laundering, and our food was cooked with a<br>method that used no fuel and gave off no heat. We bathed in warm-water<br>pools and used an internal, automated waste-disposal system. We had, in<br>this ancient, long-forgotten desert temple, every modern convenience.<br><br>The House of Ra was a secret over two thousand years old even when I was<br>there. Within those vaulted marble halls and sun-drenched galleries, magic<br>met science, philosophy met truth, wonders and miracles were merely a<br>matter of course. Years later a library would be built in Alexandria that<br>would become known as the greatest in the world; it was only a shallow<br>replica of the library contained in the vaults of the House of Ra. There<br>were never more than thirteen initiates at a time; the best and the<br>brightest of all of Egypt, hand-chosen by the Masters to live at the<br>temple and study the truths.<br><br>And what truths were those? Ah, you could spend a lifetime and still not<br>list them all. The nature of atomic particles and the nature of man, the<br>composition of chemical alloys and the mysteries of the soul. The<br>transmutation of matter, the source of all Power. To live in truth, and to<br>practice deception. Magic. Medicine. Discipline. Mastery. Good and evil.<br>Balance in all things.<br><br>We were chosen at a young age, male and female, for characteristics not<br>even our parents could identify, and from that time until we gained<br>adulthood we knew no life outside the House of Ra. It was, to the best of<br>my recollection, a very ordinary life: we played, we studied, we ate and<br>slept; we had childish spats with our classmates, we were impertinent to<br>our teachers. We had moments of great joy and deep pain, of triumph and<br>failure and enlightenment and humiliation. We grew, we learned, we loved.<br>We formed loyal friendships and casual sexual liaisons. There was nothing<br>special about us, at least in our own view. We lived in the same universe<br>that you do today; we simply learned to operate that universe according to<br>a different set of rules.<br><br>Yet I don&#x2019;t mean to minimize the grandeur of our time there; the majesty<br>of what we were becoming. Even now I have but to close my eyes and it will<br>return to me with breathless, aching wonder, the first time I understood<br>the workings of this world and the power I had over it. Let me speak the<br>words, with proper tone and rhythm, choosing the syllables and the harmony<br>they produce, let me hold the thought and say the spell, and what once was<br>is no longer so. Watch me now as I pluck from the air the electricity that<br>sparks from my fingers, for don&#x2019;t you know it was always there? And now<br>with an outstretched arm I will lift that stone with the strength of my<br>intent, and see how it floats like a feather in the air! Let me touch your<br>hand and rewrite your memory. Let me bind you with my eyes, let me whisper<br>your name and capture your will. We were dealers in magic, and magic ruled<br>the world.<br><br>I have said we, but it is important to know that not all who studied at<br>the House of Ra were of equal ability. Some would never do more than<br>master the principles of physics and chemistry that would enable them to<br>control the environment in which we must live; others might dip their<br>fingers into the stream of the human unconscious and come away with a<br>basic understanding of the arcane laws that govern existence here on<br>earth.

Wu's autobiographical novel, completed in 1945, is widely regarded as a classic of modern Asian literature and a groundbreaking expression of the postwar Taiwanese national consciousness. Originally written in Japanese and now translated into English for the first time, <i>Orphan of Asia</i> offers a powerful depiction of the political, cultural, and psychological impact of colonialism. </p><p> <i>Orphan of Asia</i> begins during Taiming's childhood in Taiwan, which has been annexed to Japan only recently. Taiming eventually makes his mark in the colonial Japanese educational system and graduates from a prestigious college. However, he finds that his Japanese education and his adoption of modern ways have alienated him from his family and native village. He becomes a teacher in the Japanese colonial system but soon realizes that there is something seriously wrong with the status quo. He quits his post but finds that, having repudiated his roots, he doesn't seem to belong anywhere.</p><p>Thus begins Taiming's long journey for his rightful place. But neither in Japan, where he goes to study physics in the belief that technology represents the future, nor in mainland China, where he marries and has a daughter, does he ever come to feel at home or find his calling. Although he assiduously avoids politics, Taiming can't help being caught up in the conflicts that shaped modern East Asian history. He is accused of spying for both China and Japan after hostilities breakout between the two countries, and he witnesses the effects of Japanese imperial expansion, the horrors of war, and the sense of anger and powerlessness felt by those living under colonial rule.</p></p><p>Born in Taiwan, raised in the scholarly traditions of ancient China but forced into the Japanese educational system, Hu Taiming, the protagonist of <i>Orphan of Asia</i>, ultimately finds himself estranged from all three cultures.

Divided, invaded and economically broken, it was a nation that some claimed had ceased to exist. By the 1960s, Italy could boast the fastest-growing economy in the world, as rural society disappeared almost overnight. </p><p> In <i>The Archipelago</i>, acclaimed historian John Foot chronicles Italy's tumultuous history from the post-war period to the present. From the silent assimilation of fascists into society after 1945 to the troubling reign of Silvio Berlusconi, and from the artistic peak of neorealist cinema to the celebration of Italy's 150th birthday in 2011, he examines both the corrupt and celebrated sides of the country. <br>While often portrayed as a failed state on the margins of Europe, Italy has instead been at the centre of innovation and change &#x2013; a political laboratory. Through stories of trials, TV programmes, songs and football matches, moments of violence and beauty, epochal social transformation and suffocating continuities, this new history tells the fascinating story of a country always marked by scandal but with the constant ability to re-invent itself. </p><p> Comprising original research and lively insights, <i>The Archipelago </i>chronicles the crises and modernisations of over seventy years of post-war Italy, from its fields, factories, squares and housing estates to the political intrigue of Rome.</p></p><p>John Foot is Professor of Modern Italian History in the Department of Italian at the University of Bristol.

His books include <i>On the Road, The Dharma Bums, Mexico City Blues, Lonesome Traveler, Scattered Poems, Visions of Cody, Pomes All Sizes, Scattered Poems</i>, and <i>Scripture of the Golden Eternity.</i>This new edition of the primary beat's private dream diaries presents the whole of Kerouac's original manuscript, including some 200-odd dreams not published in the initial selection (1961). More or less liberated from the requirements of the Beat swagger, Kerouac's writing is at times blissfully uncool, evoking an almost na ve and sentimental sensibility: " this kitty was an angel, and spoke the truth"; "nobody loves me 'cause there's no me." Correspondences between some dream characters and their counterparts in the novels are not accidental, and are correlated in a prologue (and by poet Robert Creeley, in an insightful introduction). But many facets of Kerouac's oeuvre appear here much less polished, and more naked and powerful: " My mother and I are arm in arm on the floor, I'm crying afraid to die, she's blissful and has one leg in pink sexually out between me, and I'm thinking 'Even on the verge of death women think of love &amp; snaky affection' Women? who's dreaming this?" Lost love, madness, castration, cats that speak, cats in danger of their lives, people giving birth to cats, grade school classrooms, Mel Torme, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Tolstoy and Genet all make repeated appearances, lending the collection a repetitive, nonprogrammatic logic and exposing an unfamiliar sort of vulnerable beauty in Kerouac's iconic persona. One only wonders, in the end, whether anyone, even Jack Kerouac, really has such fantastic dreams.

There would be no microscopes or telescopes, no sciences of microbiology or astronomy. People with poor vision would grope in the shadows, and planes, cars, and even electricity probably wouldn't exist. Artists would draw without the benefit of three-dimensional perspective, and ships would still be steered by what stars navigators could see through the naked eye.<br><br>In <i>Glass: A World History</i>, Alan Macfarlane and Gerry Martin tell the fascinating story of how glass has revolutionized the way we see ourselves and the world around us. Starting ten thousand years ago with its invention in the Near East, Macfarlane and Martin trace the history of glass and its uses from the ancient civilizations of India, China, and Rome through western Europe during the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Industrial Revolution, and finally up to the present day. The authors argue that glass played a key role not just in transforming humanity's relationship with the natural world, but also in the divergent courses of Eastern and Western civilizations. While all the societies that used glass first focused on its beauty in jewelry and other ornaments, and some later made it into bottles and other containers, only western Europeans further developed the use of glass for precise optics, mirrors, and windows. These technological innovations in glass, in turn, provided the foundations for European domination of the world in the several centuries following the Scientific Revolution.<br><br>Clear, compelling, and quite provocative, <i>Glass</i> is an amazing biography of an equally amazing subject, a subject that has been central to every aspect of human history, from art and science to technology and medicine.</p><p>Imagine a world without glass: no light bulbs, no windshields, no telescopes, no computer screens, and, of course, no glasses. "It is true that other substances, such as wood, bamboo, stone, and clay, can provide shelter and storage," write Alan MacFarlane and Gerry Martin in <i>Glass: A World History</i>. "What is special about glass is that it combines these and many other practical uses with the ability to extend the most potent of our senses, sight, and the most formidable of human organs, the brain." As a piece of technology, however, glass has received almost no previous attention. Nobody knows who invented it, though the ancient Egyptians or Mesopotamians are the likeliest candidates. It wasn't until Europe's early Renaissance, however, that glass was used for something more than mere jewelry and ceramics. It played a vital role in the growth of Western science, marking a key difference between European civilization and civilization everywhere else. "The invention of spectacles [in the 13th century] increased the intellectual life of professional workers by fifteen years or more," say the authors--a development of enormous economic and cultural importance that contributed to "the foundations for European domination over the whole world during the next centuries." This is a bold and beguiling thesis, and it's a wonder that it took until now for somebody to think of it and articulate it so well. <i>--John J.

All of this and much more appear in this bountifully illustrated beginner&#x2019;s guide. Start out learning the 3 basic crochet stitches and quickly move on to making geometric forms, lace patterns, edgings, and seams. By the time you&#x2019;ve worked your way though the large selection of stitches and weaves, you&#x2019;ll have mastered over 50 fundamental techniques.<br></p><p>This book is not so much a complete course in crocheting as it is an excellent reference for new and experienced stitchers. There are no patterns or designs to follow, simply a top-notch series of instructions about starting and specific stitches. This Italian import is not organized in any logical way; Irish lace motifs, like the Lancelot leaf and the eight-petal flower, for example, are discussed separately from each other with nary a cross-reference--a bit disconcerting, if not frustrating. However, the directions and full-color photographic details are truly spectacular; ideas such as ribbon borders and interlocking rings, among others, are not necessarily incorporated in other how-to books. For any age, any level. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Huck escapes his civilized life when he arranges his own &#x201c;murder&#x201d; and turns back into the backwoods, downriver yokel he started as, and in the process springing a slave, Jim, from bondage. Huck and Jim experience life as a series of tableaus as the river sweeps them through small towns on their way South. At each stop, Huck engages his talent for mixing fact with bald-faced lies to endlessly get himself out of situations... and of course, putting him into others! Huck and Jim have run-ins with desperados and family feuds and even manage to get run down by a steamboat. The adventures ratchet up when they are joined on the raft by a self-proclaimed &#x201c;duke&#x201d; and a &#x201c;king&#x201d; &#x2013; shysters both, who spend their time in figuring how to fleece the public in the little river towns. And when Jim is captured and threatened with being sent back into slavery, Huck enlists his old buddy Tom Sawyer in a frenzied, desperate, and terribly funny rescue.</p><p>A seminal work of American Literature that still commands deep praise and still elicits controversy, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> is essential to the understanding of the American soul. The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news. And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel. The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

Based on the phenomenon ignited by Dan Walsh&#x2019;s hilarious and wildly popular webcomic (beloved by <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Washington Post</i>, and hailed as &#x201c;inspired&#x201d; by Garfield creator Jim Davis), <i>Garfield Minus Garfield</i> takes everyone&#x2019;s favorite fat cat out of the picture, leaving us with only the lonely ennui of Jon as he&#x2019;s left to voice thoughts about his own existence into an empty void.<br><br><b>Featuring a foreword by Dan Walsh</b></p><p><b>Jim Davis</b>&nbsp;was born on July 28, 1945, in Marion, Indiana. He later attended Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, where he distinguished himself by earning one of the lowest cumulative grade point averages in the history of the university. The&nbsp;<i>Garfield</i>&nbsp;strip was born on June 19, 1978, syndicated in forty-one U.S. newspapers. Today it&#x2019;s syndicated in more than 2,100 newspapers worldwide with more than 200 million readers, leading Guinness World Records to name&nbsp;<i>Garfield</i>&nbsp;The Most Widely Syndicated Comic Strip in the World. Davis has had many successes with&nbsp;<i>Garfield,&nbsp;</i>including four Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program and induction into the Licensing Hall of Fame (1998), but his most prized awards are from his peers in the National Cartoonist Society: Best Humor Strip (1981 and 1985), the Elzie Segar Award (1990), and the coveted Reuben Award (1990) for overall excellence in cartooning.In an act that should qualify him for the brilliant editors hall of fame, Dan Walsh discovered that if all traces of Jim Davis's lazy, lasagna-scarfing cat were expunged from his own comic strip, <i>Garfield</i> became a funnier, much darker series, about a desperately lonely, self-loathing man's existential despair. Walsh started posting his altered strips at garfieldminusgarfield.net. And in an act that definitely qualifies him for the good sport hall of fame, Davis not only didn't sue him but approved of the project. This collection of the best de-Garfielded strips prints Walsh's altered cartoons next to Davis's originals; Davis even throws in a couple dozen Garfield-minus-Garfield strips he's done himself. Interestingly, Davis's stabs at the concept are mostly just gags about Garfield's owner, Jon Arbuckle. The gist of Walsh's approach, on the other hand, is to completely alter Davis's jokes&#x2014;a strip in which Garfield displays a single hair, announces this is all I'll be shedding today and marches off before Jon delivers a punch line, after Walsh gets through with it, becomes two panels of Jon silently glancing around before haplessly declaring, I dread tomorrow. If Samuel Beckett had been a strip cartoonist, he might've produced something like this. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A teenager at heart, she has written several novels for young adults. Check out her amazing website -- www.e-lockhart.com*Starred Review* In the summer between her freshman and sophomore years, Frankie Landau-Banks transforms from &#x201c;a scrawny, awkward child&#x201d; with frizzy hair to a curvy beauty, &#x201c;all while sitting quietly in a suburban hammock, reading the short stories of Dorothy Parker and drinking lemonade.&#x201d; On her return to Alabaster Prep, her elite boarding school, she attracts the attention of gorgeous Matthew, who draws her into his circle of popular seniors. Then Frankie learns that Matthew is a member of the Loyal Order&nbsp;of the Basset Hounds, an all-male Alabaster secret society to which Frankie&#x2019;s dad had once belonged. Excluded from belonging to or even discussing the Bassets, Frankie engineers&nbsp;her own&nbsp;guerilla membership by assuming a false online identity. Frankie is a fan of P. G. Wodehouse&#x2019;s&nbsp;books,&nbsp;and Lockhart&#x2019;s wholly engaging narrative, filled with wordplay, often reads like a clever satire about the capers&nbsp;of the entitled, interwoven with elements of a mystery. But the story&#x2019;s expertly timed comedy also has deep undercurrents. Lockhart creates a unique, indelible character in Frankie, whose oddities only make her more realistic, and teens will be galvanized by her brazen action and her passionate, immediate questions about gender and power, individuals and institutions, and how to fall in love without losing herself.

Little did she know that murder and a homicidal mummy lay in wait for her.</p><p>Archer Mayor is a death investigator for Vermont state&#39;s medical examiner, and a part-time police officer for the Bellows Falls Police Department.Joe Gunther, a Vermont Bureau of Investigation field force commander, is investigating the seemingly natural death of Michelle Fisher and the mysterious disappearance of a petty thief, as well as the activities of a fascist ex-biker terrorist and a plot to steal M-16 rifles from the National Armory. Christopher Graybill characterizes Gunther as an experienced investigator who knits together these divergent cases to methodically solve them. This police procedural is meticulously plotted, and the secondary characters are unforgettable. The villains are led by a bully portrayed by Graybill with such scorn and derision that his verbal jabs fall just short of actual punches. It's a treat to the ears when the bully meets his comeuppance.

But the siblings are quickly drawn into yet another mystery when the world's luck tips wildly out of balance (to the world's detriment).

I have always understood the art of listening.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>The last two years have been monstrously unpleasant for high-society journalist Gus Bailey. His propensity for gossip has finally gotten him into trouble&#x2014;$11 million worth. His problems begin when he falls hook, line, and sinker for a fake story from an unreliable source and repeats it on a radio program. As a result of his flip comments, Gus becomes embroiled in a nasty slander suit brought by Kyle Cramden, the powerful congressman he accuses of being involved in the mysterious disappearance of a young woman, and he fears it could mean the end of him.<br>&nbsp;<br>The stress of the lawsuit makes it difficult for Gus to focus on the novel he has been contracted to write, which is based on the suspicious death of billionaire Konstantin Zacharias. It is a story that has dominated the party conversations of Manhattan's chattering classes for more than two years. The convicted murderer is behind bars, but Gus is not convinced that justice was served. There are too many unanswered questions, such as why a paranoid man who was usually accompanied by bodyguards was without protection the very night he perished in a tragic fire.<br>&nbsp;<br>Konstantin's hot-tempered widow, Perla, is obsessed with climbing the social ladder and, as a result, she will do anything to suppress this potentially damaging story. Gus is convinced she is the only thing standing between him and the truth. <br>&nbsp;<br>Dominick Dunne revives the world he first introduced in his mega-bestselling novel <i>People Like Us</i>, and he brings readers up to date on favorite characters such as Ruby and Elias Renthal, Lil Altemus, and, of course, the beloved Gus Bailey.

He was a special correspondent for Vanity Fair for twenty-five years and was the host of the television series <i>Dominick Dunne's Power, Privilege, and Justice</i>.Dominick Dunne, who died in 2009, offers another indictment of the excesses of self-indulgent, name-dropping socialites. New York society insiders will see through Dunne&#39;s thinly disguised characterizations in this sequel to PEOPLE LIKE US (1988). Dunne&#39;s fictional alter ego, society reporter Gus Bailey, tells his story. Bailey&#39;s battling a lawsuit, and he&#39;s been contracted to write a novel based on the suspicious death of Perla Zacharias&#39;s billionaire husband. Perla, a vicious, social-climbing villainess, doesn&#39;t want the book published. Ann Marie Lee&#39;s narration is serviceable, bringing upper-crust charm to her characterizations. However, Dunne&#39;s incisive wit and sarcasm get lost in her sweet voice. Not as much fun as earlier books, but worth a listen.

Young Parvana lives with her family in one room of a bombed-out apartment building in Kabul, Afghanistan. Because he has a foreign education, her father is arrested by the Taliban, the religious group that controls the country. Since women cannot appear in public unless covered head to toe, or go to school, or work outside the home, the family becomes increasingly desperate until Parvana conceives a plan. She cuts her hair and disguises herself as a boy to earn money for her family. Parvana&#x2019;s determination to survive is the force that drives this novel set against the backdrop of an intolerable situation brought about by war and religious fanaticism. Deborah Ellis spent several months talking with women and girls in Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan and Russia. This suspenseful, timely novel is the result of those encounters. Royalties from the sale of The Breadwinner will go toward educating Afghan girls in Pakistani refugee camps. ...a potent portrait of life in contemporary Afghanistan, showing that powerful heroines can survive even in the most oppressive ... conditions.&#x201d; <i> Booklist</i></p><p>Since the Taliban took over Afghanistan, 11-year-old Parvana has rarely been outdoors. Barred from attending school, shopping at the market, or even playing in the streets of Kabul, the heroine of Deborah Ellis's engrossing children's novel <i>The Breadwinner</i> is trapped inside her family's one-room home. That is, until the Taliban hauls away her father and Parvana realizes that it's up to her to become the "breadwinner" and disguise herself as a boy to support her mother, two sisters, and baby brother. Set in the early years of the Taliban regime, this topical novel for middle readers explores the harsh realities of life for girls and women in modern-day Afghanistan. A political activist whose first book for children, <i>Looking for X</i>, dealt with poverty in Toronto, Ellis based <i>The Breadwinner</i> on the true-life stories of women in Afghan refugee camps. <p> In the wily Parvana, Ellis creates a character to whom North American children will have no difficulty relating. The daughter of university-educated parents, Parvana is thoroughly westernized in her outlook and responses. A pint-sized version of Offred from Margaret Atwood's <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>, Parvana conceals her critique of the repressive Muslim state behind the veil of her chador. Although the dialogue is occasionally stilted and the ending disappointingly sketchy, <i>The Breadwinner</i> is essential reading for any child curious about ordinary Afghans. Like so many books and movies on the subject, it is also eerily prophetic. "Maybe someone should drop a big bomb on the country and start again," says a friend of Parvana's. "'They've tried that,' Parvana said, 'It only made things worse.'" (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Lisa Alward</i></p>Read by Rita Wolf<br>approx. 3 hours<br>2 cassettes<br><br>Imagine living in a country in which women and girls are not allowed to leave the house without a man. Imagine having to wear clothes that cover every part of your body, including your face, whenever you go out.<br><br>In this powerful and realistic tale, eleven-year-old Parvana lives with her family in one room of a bombed-out apartment building in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital city during the Taliban rule. Parvana's father- a history teacher until his school was bombed and his health destroyed- works from a blanket on the ground in the marketplace, reading letters for people who cannot read or write. One day he is arrested for the crime of having a foreign education, and the family is left without someone who can earn money or even shop for food. As conditions in the family grow desperate, only one solution emerges. Forbidden by the Taliban government to earn money as a girl, Parvana must transform herself into a boy and become the breadwinner.</p><h2>Rock Jocks, Wall Rats, and Hang Dogs: Rock Climbing on the Edge of Reality</h2><p>Describes the modern sport of rock climbing, offers profiles of top climbers, and discusses the techniques of climbing</p><p>Rock climber and writer Long's account of rock climbing in California during the 1970s is slow going at first, with excess professional jargon (though a glossary does help) and mystical pronouncements ("There is no yesterday, no tomorrow, just the electric now"). But Long proves to be an expert guide once he launches into a memoir of his teenage days as a "Stonemaster" in suburban Los Angeles. Taking readers from the training grounds of Joshua Tree National Monument to the sheer walls of Yosemite, he evokes a fascinating subculture of eccentrics as obsessed with the climb as he. As he reinhabits those memories, Long creates scenes of gruelling physical exertion (he wrote the premise for the Stallone film Cliffhanger ) and begins to earn his mythic language ("Sometimes I'd filch a couple of my dad's cigars to stoke and enjoy, hanging in my butt bag, the whole world spread out below me. We were seventeen. We would never die.") Long perhaps tries to do too much, mixing dollops of history, geography, technical information and cultural overview. But he shines as a flat-out storyteller, especially in his tales of Camp 4 in Yosemite, unofficial headquarters for "rock jocks and wall rats" from around the world. He writes with affection and insight about how climbing changes people: "Their youth lay behind them like snakes' skins, and their faces had set overnight." <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Christ In The Bible Commentary Book One</h2><p>500 pages.

But what do those elf stories really tell us about the Iceland of old and the people who lived there? In this book, author Alda Sigmundsd�ttir presents twenty translated elf stories from Icelandic folklore, along with fascinating notes on the context from which they sprung.The international media has had a particular infatuation with the Icelanders&#x2019; elf belief, generally using it to propagate some kind of &#x201c;kooky Icelanders&#x201d; myth. Yet Iceland&#x2019;s elf folklore, at its core, reflects the plight of a nation living in abject poverty on the edge of the inhabitable world, and its people&#x2019;s heroic efforts to survive, physically, emotionally and spiritually. That is what the stories of the elves, or hidden people, are really about.In a country that was, at times, virtually uninhabitable, where poverty was endemic and death and grief a part of daily life, the Icelanders nurtured a belief in a world that existed parallel to their own. This was the world of the hidden people, which more often than not was a projection of the most fervent dreams and desires of the human population. The hidden people lived inside hillocks, cliffs or boulders, very close to the abodes of the humans. Their homes were furnished with fine, sumptuous objects. Their clothes were luxurious, their adornments beautiful. Their livestock was better and fatter, their sheep yielded more wool than regular sheep, their crops were more bounteous. They even had supernatural powers: they could make themselves visible or invisible at will, and they could see the future. To the Icelanders, stories of elves and hidden people are an integral part of the cultural and psychological fabric of their nation. They are a part of their identity, a reflection of the struggles, hopes, resilience and endurance of their people. All this and more is the subject of this book.</p><p>Alda Sigmundsd�ttir is an Icelandic-born writer, journalist, translator and blogger. She is author of several books, including The Little Book of the Icelanders, a humorous take on the quirks and foibles of the Icelandic people, and Living Inside the Meltdown, about the effects of Iceland&#39;s financial crash on ordinary citizens. For six years she wrote the popular blog The Iceland Weather Report, which among other things chronicled Iceland&#39;s economic meltdown and was featured in media all over the world.

S�nchez's vocal and intolerable religious deviance quickly landed him in the very court he believed he was sent to destroy. Fortunately for him, the first inquisitor assigned to his case came to believe that S�nchez was not guilty by virtue of insanity, and tried to collect the proof that would save his life.</p><p>For seven years, S�nchez shuttled between jails, hospitals, and his home village while his fate hung in the balance. Nalle convincingly evokes the compassion of S�nchez's first inquisitor, Pedro Cortes, as he struggled to save his prisoner's life, and argues that the Spanish, compared to other Europeans of the day, were remarkably rational and humane when dealing with the mentally ill.</p><p>A gripping tale of madness and religious conviction, Mad for God offers new historical insight into the ongoing debate over the nature of religious inspiration, insanity, and criminal responsibility.</p></p><p><p>Sara Tilghman Nalle is Associate Professor of History at William Paterson University and the author of God in La Mancha: Religious Reform and the People of Cuenca, 1500-1650, winner of the 1993 Roland Bainton Prize.</p><p>What a pleasure to read a book that is so well prepared and has such an engaging story to tell! Mad for God is exceptionally clear, readable, original, and substantial. Nalle interests us in the story of a man with what for his time and place were crazy ideas about God and Catholicism, and in the process teaches us much about sixteenth-century Spanish Catholicism, the Inquisition, contemporary ideas about madness, and the social control of speech and dissenters.</p> (William A. Christian, Jr., author of <i>Local Religion in Sixteenth-Century Spain</i>)<br><br><p>Mad for God is microhistory at its best, and it succeeds on multiple levels: it is a riveting narrative that has much to reveal to specialists and amateurs alike, and it is the first study to bring this case to light. Moreover, though it is focused on S�nchez exclusively, this study places the case in the context of similar contemporary phenomena in Spain and Europe, while, at the same time, revealing much about the inquisitorial process itself. Expertly accomplished, and elegantly written, there is nothing else quite like Mad for God in terms of content, form, or purpose, and it should prove to be a prime exemplar of a particular genre of history.</p> (Carlos M.

The daughter of a lady-in-waiting, Katya Ivanova is safe behind palace walls. She takes her vacations on the imperial yacht and her tea with the Tsar's daughters. The royal family feels like her own.</p><p>But outside the palace, a devastating war sweeps through Europe, and deep unrest takes root in Russia. As the flame of revolution ignites in a country where the rich have always ruled, Katya's once-certain future dissolves.</p><p>National Book Award-winning author Gloria Whelan transports readers to a crumbling, war-torn Russia, where one young woman, growing up in the shadow of a revolution, must take her future into her own hands.</p></p><p>From the author of the 2000 National Book Award winner, <i>Homeless Bird</i>, comes an evocative glimpse into a chilling period in world history. Gloria Whelan manages to take the fly-on-the-wall approach one step further in her latest piece of historical fiction. In <i>Angel on the Square</i>, a young girl joins Russian Tsar Nikolai II, Empress Alexandra, and their children when her mother becomes one of the empress's ladies-in-waiting. Katya Ivanova, as companion to the Romanov children, has an insider's view of the crumbling of tsarist Russia from 1913 to 1918. Initially, life is lavish and amusing for this young aristocrat, although her friend Misha's revolutionary ideas often battle in her mind with her own loyalty to the tsar. Gradually, though, the world outside begins to enter the palace walls, and Katya's life--along with that of all nobility--changes forever.<p> Whelan's balanced treatment of both sides of the Russian revolution is remarkably accessible. Katya is an appealing protagonist; readers will hang on her every word as she is transformed from a spoiled, sheltered child into a caring, hard-working adult. Young readers couldn't ask for a better introduction to this terrifying, earthshaking epoch in history.

Now, as Katya&#x2032;s once-certain future begins to dissolve, she must seek to understand what is happening to her beloved country and, for the first time in her life, take charge of her own destiny. </p><p> Ages 10+</p></p><h2>Southern Lady: Gracious Tables: The Perfect Setting for Any Occasion</h2><p><blockquote><p>Entertaining doyenne Phyllis Hoffman shows how to prepare a stunning table for any occasion.</p></blockquote><p>So many of the events of our lives, from the formal to the informal, are celebrated by gathering around a table.

Pondering in prayer their meaning for twenty years, she gradually came to realise their full significance.Written from the heart and borne from experience, Julian's REVELATIONS OF DIVINE LOVE is inspiring reading for all who seek to live their lives in close union with God. Her reflections are steeped in the Bible, contain many profound insights into contemplative prayer and are as relevant today as when they were originally written. The greatest of the female mystics and a spiritual guide for today, Julian additionally holds the distinction of being the first woman to write a book in the English language.This new edition includes an introduction that sets Julian in the context of her time, and a foreword by Jeremy Begbie.</p><p>"I have been reading Lady Julian of Norwich," declares C.S. Lewis in a letter to his former pupil, the Benedictine mystic Bede Griffiths. "A dangerous book, clearly. I'm glad I didn't read it much earlier." Thomas Merton wrote simply, "There can be no doubt that Julian is the greatest of the English mystics."<p></p><p>Few texts have had held such interest or been the object of such enduring devotion as has Julian of Norwich's 14th-century classic <i>A Revelation of Love</i>. This great work--along with <i>The Cloud of Unknowing</i> and Teresa of Avila's <i>The Interior Castle</i>--form the very heart of Western mysticism, and each generation has cherished its beautiful poetry and profound account of a soul's quest for the divine. This new translation of Julian's mystical writings offers today's reader immediate access to this most powerful spiritual of books written in English. Julian's message of God's intimate and enabling love is revealed as both beguiling and inescapable. The poetry and rhythmic structure of the original Middle English text are respected, yet it is given fresh immediacy since it is now rendered in inclusive language for the first time ever. Moreover Julian's key ideas are easily identified-even by newcomers to her unique system of thought-by means of an original and authoritative linking commentary at the head of each key chapter, as well as continuing support from highly informative footnotes and a detailed glossary of the main terms used.</p>Julian of Norwich&#39;s fourteenth-century classic, A Revelation of Love - along with The Cloud of Unknowing and Teresa of Avila&#39;s The Interior Castle - forms the very heart of Western mysticism, and each generation has cherished its beautiful poetry and profound account of a soul&#39;s quest for the divine.

One bundle is titled <i>Things I Know Are True</i> and the other, <i>Things I Must Not Forget</i>. The author? That would be the protagonist's mother, LuLing, who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In these documents the elderly matriarch, born in China in 1916, has set down a record of her birth and family history, determined to keep the facts from vanishing as her mind deteriorates.<p> A San Francisco career woman who makes her living by ghostwriting self-help books, Ruth has little idea of her mother's past or true identity. What's more, their relationship has tended to be an angry one. Still, Ruth recognizes the onset of LuLing's decline--along with her own remorse over past rancor--and hires a translator to decipher the packets. She also resolves to "ask her mother to tell her about her life. For once, she would ask. She would listen. She would sit down and not be in a hurry or have anything else to do."</p><p> Framed at either end by Ruth's chapters, the central portion of <i>The Bonesetter's Daughter</i> takes place in China in the remote, mountainous region where anthropologists discovered Peking Man in the 1920s. Here superstition and tradition rule over a succession of tiny villages. And here LuLing grows up under the watchful eye of her hideously scarred nursemaid, Precious Auntie. As she makes clear, it's not an enviable setting: </p><blockquote> I noticed the ripe stench of a pig pasture, the pockmarked land dug up by dragon-bone dream-seekers, the holes in the walls, the mud by the wells, the dustiness of the unpaved roads. I saw how all the women we passed, young and old, had the same bland face, sleepy eyes that were mirrors of their sleepy minds. </blockquote> Nor is rural isolation the worst of it. LuLing's family, a clan of ink makers, believes itself cursed by its connection to a local doctor, who cooks up his potions and remedies from human bones. And indeed, a great deal of bad luck befalls the narrator and her sister GaoLing before they can finally engineer their escape from China. Along the way, familial squabbles erupt around every corner, particularly among mothers, daughters, and sisters. And as she did in her earlier <i>The Joy Luck Club</i>, Amy Tan uses these conflicts to explore the intricate dynamic that exists between first-generation Americans and their immigrant elders. <i>--Victoria Jenkins</i>** Named The Library Journal&#39;s Best Audio Book of 2001 **</p><h2>Summer on Blossom Street</h2><p><br><br><strong>Knitting and life.</strong><br><br>They're both about beginnings&#x2014;and endings.

Visit her at www.DebbieMacomber.com.</p><br><br><em>Lydia Goetz</em><br><br>Wednesday morning, a not-so-perfect June day, I turned over the Open sign at my yarn store on Blossom Street. Standing in the doorway I breathed in the sweet scent of day lilies, gladiolas, roses and lavender from Susannah's Garden, the flower shop next door.<br><br>It was the beginning of summer, and although the sky was overcast and rain threatened to fall at any moment, the sun shone brightly in my heart. (My husband, Brad, always laughs when I say things like that. But I don't care. As a woman who's survived cancer not once but twice, I feel entitled to the occasional sentimental remark. Especially today...)<br><br>I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, enjoying the early-morning peace. I just don't think there's anyplace more beautiful than Seattle in the summer. All the flowers spilling out of Susannah's Garden are one of the benefits. The array of colors, as well as the heady perfume drifting in my direction, makes me so glad A Good Yarn is located where it is.<br><br>Whiskers, my shop cat, as Brad calls him, ambled across the hardwood floor and leaped into the window display, nestling among the skeins of pastel yarns. He takes up residence there most days and has long been a neighborhood favorite. The apartment upstairs is an extra storeroom for yarn at the moment; perhaps one day I'll rent it out again but that isn't in the plans yet.<br><br>The French Caf� across the street was already busy, as it is every morning. The windows were filled with pastries, breads and croissants warm from the oven, and their delectable aroma added to the scents I associate with summer on Blossom Street. Alix Turner is usually there by five to bake many of these wonderful temptations. She's one of my dearest friends&#x2014;and was among my first customers. I'm so proud of everything she's accomplished in the past few years. It's fair to say she reinvented her life&#x2014;with a little help from her friends. She has an education and a career now, and she's married to a man who seems completely right for her.<br><br>Blossom Street Books down the street was ready for business, too. Anne Marie Roche and her staff often leave the front door open as a welcoming gesture, inviting those who wander past to come inside and browse. She and her daughter, Ellen, would be coming home from Paris later today.<br><br>Nearly every afternoon Ellen walks their Yorkie past the window so Whiskers and Baxter can stare fiercely at each other. Ellen insists it's all for show, that the cat and dog are actually good friends but don't want any of us to know that.<br><br>I grinned at Whiskers because I couldn't resist sharing my joy and excitement&#x2014;even with the cat. In fact, I wanted to tell the whole world my news. Yesterday, we found out that we'd been approved for adoption. I hadn't yet shared this information with anyone, including my sister, Margaret. We've been through the interviews, the home test and fingerprinting. And last night we heard.<br><br>We're going to adopt a baby.<br><br>Because of my cancer, pregnancy is out of the question. While the ability to conceive has been taken from me, the desire for a baby hasn't. It's like an ache that never quite goes away. As much as possible I've tried to hide this from Brad. Whenever thoughts of what cancer has stolen from me enter my head, I try hard to counter them by remembering all the blessings I've received in my life. I want to celebrate every day, savor every minute, without resentment or regret.<br><br>I have so much for which to be grateful. I'm alive and cancer-free. I'm married to a man I adore. His son, Cody, now nine years old, has become my son, too. And I have a successful business, one that brings me great pleasure and satisfaction. When I first opened A Good Yarn, it was my way of shouting to the world that I refused to let cancer rob me of anything else. I was going to <em>live </em>and I was going to do it without the constant threat of illness and death. I was determined to bask in the sunshine. I still am.<br><br>So A Good Yarn was the start of my new life. Within a year of opening the store, I met Brad Goetz and we were married the following spring. Because of what I'd been through in my teens and again in my twenties, I didn't have a lot of experience with men or relationships. At first, Brad's love terrified me. Then I learned not to reject something good just because I was afraid of its loss. I learned that I could trust this man&#x2014;and myself.<br><br>How blessed I am to be loved by him and Cody. Each and every day I thank God for the two men in my life.<br><br>Even with all I have, my arms ached to hold a baby. <em>Our baby. </em>Brad, who knows me so well, understood my need. After discussing the subject for weeks on end, after vacillating, weighing the pros and cons, we'd reached our decision.<br><br>Yes, we were going to adopt.<br><br>The catalyst for all this happened when Anne Marie Roche adopted eight-year-old Ellen.<br><br>I realized the wait for a newborn might be lengthy but we were both prepared for that. Although we'd be thrilled with an infant of either sex, I secretly longed for a little girl.<br><br>I heard the back door close and turned to see my sister, Margaret. She's worked with me almost from the first day I opened the shop. Although we're as different as any two sisters could be, we've become close.<br><br>Margaret is a good balance for me, ever practical and pragmatic, and I think I balance her, too, since I'm much more optimistic and given to occasional whimsy.<br><br>"Good morning!" I greeted her cheerfully, unable to disguise my happiness.<br><br>"It's going to pour," she muttered, taking off her raincoat and hanging it in the back storeroom.<br><br>My sister tends to see the negative. The glass would always be half-empty to Margaret. Or completely empty&#x2014;if not shattered on the floor. Over the years I've grown accustomed to her attitude and simply ignore it.<br><br>When she'd finished removing her coat, Margaret stared at me, then frowned. "Why are <em>you </em>so happy?" she demanded. "Anybody can see we're about to have a downpour."<br><br>"Me? Happy?" There wasn't much point in trying to hold back my news, even though I knew Margaret was the one person who wouldn't understand my pleasure. She'd disapprove and would have no qualms about imparting her opinion. It's her pessimistic nature, I suppose, and the fact that she worries about me, although she'd never admit that.<br><br>Margaret continued to glare. "You're grinning from ear to ear."<br><br>I made busy work at the cash register in order to avoid eye contact. I might as well tell her, although I dreaded her response. "Brad and I have applied for adoption," I blurted out, unable to stop myself. "And our application's been accepted."<br><br>A startled silence followed.<br><br>"I know you think we're making a mistake," I rushed to add.<br><br>"I didn't say that." Margaret walked slowly toward me.<br><br>"You didn't need to <em>say </em>anything," I told her. Just once I wanted Margaret to be happy for me, without doubts and objections and concerns. "Your silence said it all."<br><br>Margaret joined me at the counter next to the cash register. She seemed to sense that her reaction had hurt me. "I'm only wondering if adoption's a wise choice for you."<br><br>"Margaret," I began, sighing as I spoke. "Brad and I know what we're doing." Although Margaret hadn't said it openly, I could guess what concerned her most. She was afraid the cancer would return. I'm well aware of the possibility and have been ever since its recurrence ten years ago. It was a serious consideration and one that neither Brad nor I took lightly.<br><br>"Brad agrees?" My sister sounded skeptical.<br><br>"Of course he agrees! I'd never go against his wishes."<br><br>Margaret still didn't look convinced. "You're <em>sure </em>this is what you want?"<br><br>"Yes." I was adamant. Sometimes that's the only way to reach her. "Brad knows the risks as well as I do. You don't need to spell it out, Margaret. I understand why you're afraid for me, but I'm through with living in fear."<br><br>Margaret's eyes revealed her apprehensions. She studied me and after a moment asked, "What if the adoption agency doesn't find you a child?"<br><br>This was something Brad and I had discussed and it could certainly happen. I shrugged. "Nothing ventured, nothing gained. We'll take the chance."<br><br>"You want an infant?"<br><br>"Yes." I pictured a newborn, wrapped in a soft pink blanket, gently placed in my waiting arms. I held on to the image, allowing it to bring me comfort, to fill me with hope.<br><br>To my surprise Margaret didn't immediately voice another objection.

National ad/promo.</p><p>A tasteless, tell-all bio of the outrageous, screaming stand- up comic Kinison, by his manager/brother. But how else to write the life story of a comedian whose tag line was ``Oh! Oh! Aaaaaaugh!'' and whose on-stage rantings included riffs on serial killers, sissy POWs, Satan, crucifixion, Charles Manson, world hunger, cunnilingus, and homosexual necrophilia? The son of a blackballed Pentecostal minister, Kinison was a ``traveling evangelist'' until 1978 when he decided to try stand-up comedy. Starting out in Houston, he felt by 1980 that his loud, vulgar, abrasive routine was ready for the famed Comedy Store in Los Angeles. It took a few years, but by 1983 Kinison had become a ``paid regular.'' He parlayed his growing local notoriety into spots on an HBO special and in Rodney Dangerfield's film Back to School. By 1985, he was nationally known, his screaming diatribes against women and marriage earning him close to $1 million annually. But his drinking, excessive drug use, and abuse of his wives and numerous lovers (who included director Penny Marshall, actress Beverly D'Angelo, and porn star Seka) would take their toll. Despite such powerful admirers as Robin Williams, Howard Stern, and David Letterman, Kinison would alienate the power brokers who might have solidified his career. The ``rock and roll'' comic, Kinison will perhaps best be remembered for his video rendition of ``Wild Thing,'' in which he spits and screams abuse at a writhing, delirious Jessica Hahn (yet another former lover) while snarling Billy Idol and a motley crew of heavy-metal heroes join the fun. Kinison died at the age of 38 in a car accident. At least, writes his brother, ``he did not die of excess'' like John Belushi. Unrestrained, ugly, and grotesquely, perversely captivating. Like the man himself. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>"Shock comedian" Kinison (1953-1992) was born in Yakima, Wash., the son of a Pentecostal preacher. A head injury at age three (he was hit by a truck) turned a reticent child into a rambunctious youth, who got his kicks by snatching handbags. After a stint as an itinerant preacher, Kinison decided to become a comedian and moved to Houston, where he was named the funniest man in Texas by the Dallas Morning News . A move to Los Angeles briefly stalled his career until the help of Rodney Dangerfield and an HBO special led to appearances on David Letterman and Johnny Carson and Saturday Night Live . Bill, Sam's brother, fellow preacher and manager, has written, along with freelancer Delsohn, an X-rated memoir about a very sleazy man. This book is filled with the sordid details of Sam's life: his drug use (acid, Quaaludes, cocaine, marijuana, amyl nitrate); his penchant for .38s and three-way sex; feuds with Andrew Dice Clay and Howard Stern; the suicide of their brother Kevin; Sam's problems with the gay community; his affairs with the likes of Penny Marshall, Beverly D'Angelo, porn star Seka and Jessica Hahn; his three marriages; and his death in an auto accident.

By year&#x2019;s end, they had all declared national independence, embarking on the road to democracy. How did it happen so quickly? Why did the USSR capitulate so readily? Victor Sebestyen, who was on the scene reporting for the London <i>Evening Standard </i>at the time, draws on his firsthand knowledge of the events of 1989, on scores of interviews with other witnesses and participants, and on newly uncovered archival material to answer these questions in unprecedented depth. <br><br>Sebestyen tells the story through the eyes of ordinary men and women, some of whom found themselves almost miraculously transformed: the furnace stoker who became the Czech foreign minister; the Romanian poet who, just freed from jail, was made vice president of the newly liberated nation. He shows how power was wielded or ceded by Mikhail Gorbachev, George H. W. Bush, Lech Walesa, V�clav Havel, and Margaret Thatcher, among others; how the KGB helped bring down former allied regimes; how the United States tried to slow the process; and why the collapse of the Iron Curtain was the catalyst for the fall of the entire Soviet empire. <br><br>Authoritative, riveting in both its broad political sweep and its abundance of personal detail, this is an essential addition to the annals of contemporary history.</p><p><strong>Victor Sebestyen on <i>Revolution 1989</i></strong><br> <ul> <li>The principal reasons the Soviet empire fell was the USSR's disastrous decade-long war in Afghanistan, which is eerily reminiscent of the conflict the West is involved in now. Soviet generals of 20 or 25 years ago were saying almost identical things about their war against the Mujahideen (The Army of God) as NATO soldiers are saying now fighting the Taleban. Just substitute the names and it would be hard to spot the difference. Even more topically, many of the places where battles are being fought now are the same as then.</li> <li>Almost nobody predicted the sudden and speedy collapse of Communism--and its defeat was the last war that the West won. Almost nobody in politics, diplomacy, the military, the media or academia saw it coming. Least of all was it predicted by the intelligence agencies.</li> <li>Despite trillions of dollars and rubles spent on spying in forty years of Cold War--as well as a vast industry in espionage books and movies--the spooks in the East and West were hopelessly ill informed. The CIA consistently over-emphasized the strength of the Soviet bloc. Even in the Spring of 1989 the then Director of the CIA, Robert Gates, said the Soviets would use force to keep their hold on the East Europe states and, amongst other wrong calls, said the Kremlin would "never" let the Berlin Wall come down. Robert Gates is now US Secretary for Defense.</li> <li>Ronald Reagan was a great President, but he is admired for the wrong reasons. The classsic explanation for the collapse of Communism is that Reagan's tough rhetoric against the "Evil Empire" and his arms build-up defeated the Soviets. Quite the opposite is true. We can now take a more nuanced view. When he took a hard line Reagan got nowhere. In fact, it nearly led to a nuclear war by accident. He was successful when he took a soft line and began negotiating with the Russians, in particular with Mikhail Gorbachev. His greatness was in seizing that opportunity--not by ideology. It is hard to see why Reagan is a hero amongst conservatives at all.</li> <li>Western bankers did more to bring down Communism than did Presidents or Prime Ministers. Foreign debt forced a crisis in countries like Poland and East Germany and Hungary, which were spending three quarters of their income on paying the interest on loans from the West. The debt crisis--another topical theme now--was a vital factor in the story of 1989.</li> <li>The book reveals new information about how the first President Bush tried to slow down the process of change in 1989. He was worried the revolutions were happening so quickly that "global security" was at risk and that some of the East European dissidents were not ready to take power. There is a dramatic scene in the book when George Bush goes to Poland in the summer of '89 to plead with the Communist general in charge of the country to cling on to office for a while longer. <i>&#x2014;Victor Sebestyen</i></li> </ul> <p>(Photo � Stacey Mutkin)</p><b>VICTOR SEBESTYEN </b>is the author of <i>Twelve Days: The Story of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution</i>.

He has taught journalism and nonfiction writing at Smith, Mount Holyoke, and Boston University.Antidote INTRODUCTION<p></p> <br>Why I Went Back Inside Vertex<br> <br>Twenty years ago, I wrote a book about a bold and bruising quest. It told the story of a group of entrepreneurial young scientists who left the world&#x2019;s best drug company&#x2014;the most admired business in America year after year&#x2014;because they were confident they would be more productive on their own, starting from scratch. They aimed to design better drugs, atom by atom. Most people across the industry thought their project in a refitted construction company garage in Cambridge, Massachusetts&#x2014;to build an organization that could produce dramatically improved medicines to transform the lives of people with serious diseases&#x2014;was a pipe dream, a money pit, a consuming act of arrogance, an exhausting feat of hubris, a fool&#x2019;s errand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think this is five years too early?&#x201d; founding scientist and president Joshua Boger was often asked. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he would say, &#x201c;but five years from now it&#x2019;ll be five years too late.&#x201d;<br> <br>I found their passionate belief in science and in themselves, brimming with high purpose and combative glee, stirring and infectious as I followed them around for a couple of years while they tried to get their cash-starved company, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, off the ground. It was a rocky, exhilarating, eye-opening ride. The chase for new leads was fierce, not just against &#x201c;Mother Merck&#x201d; but also top academic labs, including those led by some of their own scientific advisors, who they feared were sharing Vertex&#x2019;s most prized insights with its rivals. When Boger settled for a tie in a race to publication against one of them, a Harvard professor, he told me: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take it. But I want to rub his nose in the dirt and step on his head.&#x201d;<br> <br>Such was the knife-edge between cooperation and competition in the new biopharmaceutical order. Whatever unease I felt at witnessing up close how ferocious capitalism and scientific rivalries&#x2014;rather than, say, altruism&#x2014;drove the search for new lifesaving drugs receded in the wake of Vertex&#x2019;s precocious early success. Boger assembled a team of talented, rampantly motivated biologists, chemists, biophysicists, and computer scientists while he and his chief lieutenant tap-danced their way around the world to raise the money they would need to compete with the pharmaceutical behemoths. Though they were spectacularly outspent and outmanned in every area, he let them organize themselves, rather than try to direct them from above. He let them fail, time and again, until they came up with better approaches. He was a visionary goal setter, an inspirer.<br> <br>Against all odds, within four years Vertex proved it could compete at the forefront of drug research, against the industry leaders, in several major areas at once. It had gone public and Wall Street considered it a hot stock. What I saw impressed me as a worthy, honest, compelling, even noble effort both to beat and influence the world around it&#x2014;a world where life-changing new drugs were getting harder and harder to find despite the best efforts of hundreds of companies employing tens of thousands of equally gifted and passionate researchers and spending hundreds of billions of dollars on research and development.<br> <br>That was the story I told in The Billion-Dollar Molecule. I was encouraged by the company&#x2019;s progress; pleased, too, that the book was acclaimed as an insightful look inside the world of commercial medicine. But I understood that the upstart-biotech-looks-promising version of events that I had reported wasn&#x2019;t the full story, or even the main one. Boger had set out to build a drug company, but Vertex hadn&#x2019;t yet produced a drug. Nowhere near it. For him and the other company pioneers, the larger prize wasn&#x2019;t organizing a research group to find better compounds; it was to build a business that could go head-to-head with the world&#x2019;s most profitable drugmakers against the hardest diseases, involving some of competitive capitalism&#x2019;s most complicated science and most cutthroat marketing maneuvers.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d described the opening skirmish, not the war.<br> <br><br> <br>The modern pharmaceutical industry emerged from one of the great triumphs of twentieth-century science. Before the 1940s, there were medicines and companies that made them, but no one had invented a method for actively finding and developing new drugs. Profits in medicine were disdained as suspect&#x2014;immoral&#x2014;and the companies were essentially manufacturers of fine chemical compounds. Since their products could do as much harm as good, integrity was key. Then university laboratories advanced a new approach: microbial screening. Systematically harvesting large numbers of chemicals from &#x201c;good bugs&#x201d; and feeding them to &#x201c;bad bugs,&#x201d; then monitoring and improving their activity, drugmakers produced and brought to patients the first antibacterials that had been actively sought and developed.<br> <br>The chase was on: for new diseases to treat, testing strategies, business opportunities, scientists, alliances with leading doctors, prestige, and money. As with all things in America, World War II was the great catalyst. Just as the companies were flexing their research and development arms to tackle other diseases, the government enlisted them in the war effort. In 1941 the Germans were rumored to have isolated the chemical secretion of the adrenal cortex, cortisone, and given it to their pilots, amping them up, emboldening them. Battlefield wounds and home-front contagions drove the need for better antibiotics, vaccines, pain relievers, and surgical products. Drugmakers were marshaled to counter the threat of a pharmacologic arms race. By midcentury, US companies had more than matched the government&#x2019;s urgency, and were racing ahead, developing new biological models to screen against. Profits began to pour in. Wall Street stood up and took notice. The companies grew spectacularly.<br> <br>Merck, where Boger started his career in 1979 after getting a PhD in chemistry at Harvard and doing a postdoctoral stint with future Nobel laureate Jean-Marie Lehn, was their paragon. It best represented the qualities that the industry exalted, a patient-centered, high-science focus combined with unrivaled organizational commitment to R&amp;D. It wasn&#x2019;t always the most profitable drug company&#x2014;Pfizer and others were better at making money&#x2014;but its research campuses in New Jersey and outside Philadelphia attracted the most promising scientists. It was where you wanted to be, the top of the pyramid.<br> <br>In the 1970s and 1980s, with the swift expansion of government-sponsored research spurred on by the &#x201c;war on cancer,&#x201d; and as the universities and Wall Street simultaneously discovered a bonanza in the life sciences, there was an explosion in medical understanding, and the low-hanging fruit were quickly plucked. Merck&#x2019;s labs launched the first or second significant drugs for cholesterol, hypertension, osteoporosis, and asthma, as well as a class of pain medications known as COX-2 inhibitors. At Merck as elsewhere, scientists burned to do pathbreaking work on new medical frontiers, but increasingly, in management suites and boardrooms across the industry, the consequences of success yielded a conservative strategic consensus: move cautiously rather than struggle to produce breakthroughs; settle for modest &#x201c;quick-to-market&#x201d; improvements where treatments already exist, and where the resulting products can be aggressively marketed to doctors and people with chronic diseases.<br> <br>Gradualism held zero appeal for Boger. &#x201c;Now, I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s anything wrong with bringing an incremental advance to the marketplace; you&#x2019;re not a bad person,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just I don&#x2019;t want to do that; life&#x2019;s too short.&#x201d; Biotechnology companies by now had joined the competition. A few top university professors or government scientists with a tantalizing idea could raise tens of millions of dollars, go out and test it, then go public&#x2014;public&#x2014;when all they had to sell to investors was a theory and the only certainty in their business model was years and years of progressively more unprofitable darkness. Wall Street blew hot and cold, periodically falling hard for their stories of genetic breakthroughs and miracle cures before returning to its senses. Merck, recognizing Boger&#x2019;s talents (if not buying into his ideas about building better drugs by applying advances from the biotech, software, and computer graphics industries), encouraged him to do his experiment, letting him piece together a team in immunology. But he quickly felt thwarted, impatient. Pent-up.<br> <br>His frustrations crystallized in the late 1980s, as many things did across the medical world, with the AIDS crisis. Drugmakers at first ignored the epidemic, seeing a small market. Off-the-shelf compounds were ineffective and toxic. When Merck entered the arena, many doctors, public health officials, and even some activists felt that the cavalry had arrived. Boger&#x2019;s closest scientific friend in the company, a brilliant and brash young biologist named Irving Sigal, led Merck&#x2019;s project, and Boger cleared the decks in his group to help. CEO Roy Vagelos announced he was &#x201c;damn optimistic&#x201d; about Merck&#x2019;s chances. In late 1988, returning from a meeting in Europe, Sigel was killed when Pan Am Flight 103, carrying 259 people and a terrorist organization&#x2019;s bomb in a cargo container, exploded in a fireball over Lockerbie, Scotland. He was thirty-five. Merck scrambled to recover from its loss.<br> <br>Within a month, Boger was gone.<br> <br><br> <br>So I was there when Vertex set out in its garage to overtake the &#x201c;bigs.&#x201d; And what I saw were staggering contrasts. The major pharmaceutical companies were lumbering along; mightily equipped, cash-rich, charging higher and higher prices while bringing out fewer and fewer important new drugs, their reputation for putting profit before patients replayed and reinforced in the AIDS epidemic. It was fifteen years into the war on cancer, and cancer was winning in a rout. The biotechs had yet to pay out, and Wall Street was skittish about their high failure rate and the chronic risk and volatility of an industry where horizons were measured in decades. It was into this environment that Boger led his young company.<br> <br>Now leap ahead to early 2011: the grinding recovery from the worst financial crisis in eighty years, the raging political storm over Obamacare, a drumbeat of lurid press reports about the drug business, revealing an industry in crisis and under siege. Vertex, after twenty-two years and $3.6 billion in losses, was about to launch its first drug under its own name, a major breakthrough against the leading cause of advanced liver disease. It had a second drug nearing regulatory approval that promised to revolutionize the treatment of the most common inherited fatal disease in the United States and Europe. Just as the world around it was shuddering, Vertex was poised to soar. What better vantage point for witnessing the mounting collision of medicine, money, and society?<br> <br>I went back inside Vertex to learn what it takes&#x2014;to succeed in science and business, yes, but also in fleshing out and struggling to achieve a radical vision of a better future. Could a group of very bright, very determined people make a difference in a market dominated by profits and Wall Street? Could true believers in the idea that the purpose of pharmaceutical research is to put patients first and transform the lives of sick people compete in an industry where it was far preferable to develop, say, a marginally better fifth statin compound for high cholesterol and market the hell out of it, as Pfizer had done with the bestselling drug of all time, Lipitor? Or bury a $500 million sweetheart reimbursement in the Fiscal Cliff deal, as Amgen did with its army of seventy-seven lobbyists? Or pay a generic company $42 million not to market a cheaper version of your drug, so you can keep selling it at ten times the cost to consumers, as in a recent restraint-of-trade case before the Supreme Court? Could Vertex still be Vertex in our genomic age, when understanding which drugs to prescribe will depend on an ever-deepening biological profiling of individual patients?<br> <br>What was I seeking? Hope, really. The $325 billion prescription drug business is America&#x2019;s most challenging and one of its most profitable. It&#x2019;s tougher and riskier at nearly every stage than any other business. Yawning biological uncertainties haunt every experiment; the failure rate even after a candidate clears all the myriad hurdles to reach human testing is 30 to 1; the cost of ramping up a successful product typically exceeds $1 billion. Drugmakers operate in the world&#x2019;s most regulated commercial environment, matched only by nuclear power. Small companies face an extra test. Dependent on Wall Street for financing, they must navigate a myopic trading culture that disdains and crowds out long-term thinking and investment. All progress in the pharmaceutical business is backbreaking, freighted with unknowns, takes twice as long as you think it will, and is liable to &#x201c;blow at any seam,&#x201d; as Tom Wolfe wrote about the endless ineffable peril of staking it all on a lofty high-risk mission.<br> <br>Mostly I wanted to see what it had taken to prevail against such harrowing obstacles: What had Boger&#x2019;s vision become, and did it represent a true way ahead in our boundlessly promising and still barely comprehended new biological epoch? After he&#x2019;d resigned from Merck&#x2014;alone, without first taking anyone with him, and without any assurance that anyone would follow&#x2014;Boger went home and sketched his goals on a whiteboard: &#x201c;Make better drugs, faster. Create the 21st century biopharmaceutical company. Become Merck, only better.&#x201d; It was almost a haiku. He thought it would take him twenty years and $1 billion. Now, just two years late, at nearly four times the cost, Vertex verged on proving all that he had set out to do.<br> <br>&#x201c;One of the most common questions I&#x2019;ve gotten lately is, &#x2018;Gee, did you ever imagine this would occur?&#x2019; &#x201d; he told Vertex&#x2019;s sales troops that spring. It was a few days after Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan after a decade-long manhunt, and the company was counting down to launch, primed to go one-on-one against Merck for the richest commercial opportunity in pharma. &#x201c;My completely unsatisfying answer is, &#x2018;Yes, absolutely.&#x2019; Now, that comes across to some people as fairly arrogant, and to that I say arrogance is only a problem if it doesn&#x2019;t turn out to be true. If it turns out to be true, it&#x2019;s just persistence.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;d discovered at Vertex that biomedical research emits a high emotional heat. It may be tempting to think that the competitive commitment in other disruptive tech industries is similar but the comparison is slender. In Silicon Valley, you&#x2019;re trying to make a better product, not cure cystic fibrosis or Parkinson&#x2019;s disease. Here the difference between success and failure can be the difference between life and death. Vertex was about to debut not only the first drugs discovered and developed by its own people and commercialized under its own label. It was about to debut itself, an organization of nearly two thousand people sculpted as much by the changing health care economy and the gyrations of its industry over the past two decades as by Boger and the others who joined him. They had had notable early success in the crucible of that new biomedical order&#x2014;AIDS&#x2014;but that victory had been pyrrhic because, while it had produced a drug, Vertex hadn&#x2019;t fully emerged along with it. Now the company would correct that disparity.<br> <br>Boger was right about arrogance. We may not like it in our faces, but it&#x2019;s a problem only when it doesn&#x2019;t turn...</p><h2>Because of Winn-Dixie Signature Edition</h2><p><b>A beautiful gift edition featuring the author&#x2019;s signature stamped on the cover.</b><br><br>Millions of people around the world are devoted to the novels of Kate DiCamillo &#x2014; and it all began with&nbsp;<i>Because of Winn-Dixie</i>.

He planted a garden and attempted to follow Thoreau's example: do not impose your will upon the wilderness, the woodchucks, or the weeds. That ethic did not, of course, work. But neither did pesticides or firebombing the woodchuck burrow. So Michael Pollan began to think about the troubled borders between nature and contemporary life.<br><br>The result is a funny, profound, and beautifully written book in the finest tradition of American nature writing. It inspires thoughts on the war of the roses; sex and class conflict in the garden; virtuous composting; the American lawn; seed catalogs, and the politics of planting a tree. A blend of meditation, autobiography, and social history, <b>Second Nature</b> is ultimately a modern <b>Walden</b>: a true classic for our time.</p><p>Michael Pollan is Executive Editor of <i>Harper's Magazine.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;His writing on the garden and nature has appeared in <i>The New York Times Magazine, Harper's</i> and <i>Best American Essays.</i><b>Introduction</b><br><br>This book is the story of my education in the garden. The garden in question is actually two, one more or less imaginary, the other insistently real. The first is the garden of books and memories, that dreamed-of outdoor utopia, gnat-free and ever in bloom, where nature answers to our wishes and we imagine feeling perfectly at home. The second garden is an actual place, consisting of the five acres of rocky, intractable hillside in the town of Cornwall, Connecticut, that I have been struggling to cultivate for the past seven years. Much separates these two gardens, though every year I bring them a little more closely into alignment.<br><br>Both of these gardens have had a lot to teach me, and not only, as it turned out, about gardening. For I soon came to the realization that I would not learn to garden very well before I'd also learned about a few other things: about my proper place in nature (was I within my rights to murder the woodchuck that had been sacking my vegetable garden all spring?); about the somewhat peculiar attitudes toward the land that an American is born with (why is it the neighbors have taken such a keen interest in the state of my lawn?); about the troubled borders between nature and culture; and about the experience of place, the moral implications of landscape design, and several other questions that the wish to harvest a few decent tomatoes had not prepared me for. It may be my nature to complicate matters unduly, to search for large meanings in small things, but it did seem that there was a lot more going on in the garden than I'd expected to find.<br><br>I began gardening for the same reasons people usually do: for the satisfaction of pulling bunches of carrots from one's own ground; the desire to make a patch of land more hospitable or productive; the urge to recover a place remembered from childhood, and the basic need to keep the forest from swallowing up one's house. When my wife and I bought our first place in 1983--a sliver of a derelict dairy farm on the eastern edge of the Housatonic Valley--we had been living in Manhattan for some time, in an apartment that receives approximately ninety minutes of sunlight a day, and the prospect of growing a few flowers and vegetables seemed exotic. There was also the matter of the advancing forest, which did in fact threaten to engulf our house, a little cape that had been assembled from a Sears, Roebuck kit in 1929. I had to do <i>something</i>--either mow the weed patch that passed for a lawn, or put in a real garden-if I hoped to keep the woods at bay.<br><br>So I guess you could say the forest made me do it. But there was also, mixed in with my motives, the recollected satisfactions of childhood gardens. Growing up on Long Island in the early 1960s, I'd cared for a succession of pocket gardens in various corners of my parents' suburban plot, and had spent many Saturdays helping out my grandfather in the much grander garden he tended a few miles away (Chapter 1 is a reminiscence of these places). Now I had some ground of my own, and gardening it seemed a natural way to spend my weekends, something I might even have a knack for.<br><br>Judith had other ideas. Though her position would eventually soften, she started out a sworn enemy of gardening, having been forced as a child to do yard work. I think she was also less troubled by the derelict parts of our property than I was, finding beauty in the march of brush across an abandoned hay field, or the rank, top-heavy growth of an apple tree in need of hard pruning. So she began making landscape paintings and I, with somewhat less striking results, began making landscapes.<br><br><b>* * *</b><br><br>It wasn't very long before I discovered I was ill-prepared for the work I'd taken on. The local New England landscape--a patchwork of abandoned farms swiftly being overtaken by second-growth forest--proved far less amenable to my plans for it than the tame suburban plots of my childhood had. Here were large and rapacious animals, hegemonies of weeds, a few billion examples of every insect in the field guide, killing frosts in June and September, and boulders of inconceivable weight and number. But there were obstacles of a very different kind that proved just as vexing: the unexamined attitudes toward nature that I'd brought with me to the garden.<br><br>Like most Americans out-of-doors, I was a child of Thoreau. But the ways of seeing nature I'd inherited from him, and the whole tradition of nature writing he inspired, seemed not to fit my experiences. In confronting the local woodchucks, or deciding whether I was obliged to mow my lawn, or how liberal I could afford to be with respect to weeds, I was deep in nature, surely, but my feelings about it, although strong, were something other than romantic, or worshipful. When one summer I came across Emerson's argument that "weeds" (just then strangling my annuals) were nothing more than a defect of my perception, I felt a certain cognitive dissonance. Everybody wrote about how to <i>be</i> in nature, what sorts of perceptions to have, but nobody about how to <i>act</i> there. Yet the gardener, unlike the naturalist, has to, indeed <i>wants</i> to, act.<br><br>Now it is true that there are countless volumes of practical advice available to the perplexed gardener, but I felt the need for some philosophical guidance as well. Before I firebomb a woodchuck burrow, I like to have a bit of theory under my belt. Yet for the most part, Americans who write about nature don't write about the garden--about man-made landscapes and the processes of their making. This is an odd omission, for although gardening may not at first seem to hold the drama or grandeur of, say, climbing mountains, it is gardening that gives most of us our most direct and intimate experience of nature--of its satisfactions, fragility, and power.<br><br>Yet traditionally, when we have wanted to think about our relationship to nature, we have gone to the wilderness, to places untouched by man. Thoreau, in fact, was the last important American writer on nature to have anything to say about gardening. He planted a bean field at Walden and devoted a chapter to his experiences in it. But the bean field (which I talk about in my chapter on weeds) got Thoreau into all sorts of trouble. His romance of wild nature left him feeling guilty about discriminating against weeds (he rails against the need for such "invidious distinctions") and he couldn't see why he was any more entitled to the harvest of his garden than the resident woodchucks and birds. Badly tangled up in contradictions between his needs and nature's prerogatives, Thoreau had to forsake the bean field, eventually declaring that he would prefer the most dismal swamp to any garden. With that declaration, the garden was essentially banished from American writing on nature.<br><br>I think this is unfortunate, and not just because I happen to stand in need of sound advice in the garden. Americans have a deeply ingrained habit of seeing nature and culture as irreconcilably opposed; we automatically assume that whenever one gains, the other must lose. Forced to choose, we usually opt for nature (at least in our books). This choice, which I believe is a false one, is what led Thoreau and his descendants out of the garden. To be sure, there is much to be learned in the wilderness; our unsurpassed tradition of nature writing is sufficient proof of that. But my experience in the garden leads me to believe that there are many important things about our relationship to nature that <i>cannot</i> be learned in the wild. For one thing, we need, and now more than ever, to learn how to use nature without damaging it. That probably can't be done as long as we continue to think of nature and culture simply as antagonists. So how do we begin to find some middle ground between the two? To provide for our needs and desires without diminishing nature? The premise of this book is that the place to look for some of the answers to these questions may not be in the woods, but in the garden.<br><br><b>* * *</b><br><br>Though this book is not a polemic, it is full of argument: between me and this vexing piece of land, and also between me and some of the traditional ways of looking at nature in America; I find I spend a lot of time arguing with Thoreau. Many of these arguments don't get settled; this book is an exercise in discovery rather than truth telling. It is, as I say, the story of an education, and, as will be clear from the high incidence of folly in these pages, I remain more pupil than teacher. I know more at the end of my narrative than I did at the beginning, and for the most part I have followed the logic of my experiences, as they unfolded season by season, rather than that of any thesis. Even so, there is, I think, threading through this book (and spelled out in some detail in Chapter 10), a single underlying argument: that the idea of a garden--as a place, both real and metaphorical, where nature and culture can be wedded in a way that can benefit both--may be as useful to us today as the idea of wilderness has been in the past. This might strike readers as a rather unfashionably optimistic notion. In fact I share the general sense of alarm about our environment; I do not, however, share the gathering sense of despair. I find, in the garden, some grounds for hope.<br><br>What are my qualifications to write such a book? Certainly I am no expert--not on gardening, or nature, or much of anything else, for that matter. This is very much the enterprise of an amateur. My sole qualification (if it may be called that) is the wager I decided to make at the beginning of this project: that gardening might be worth taking seriously, and that, closely attended to, it might yield some good stories and helpful ideas. Yet I suspect that once I began to garden, this book was probably inevitable. As most gardeners will testify, the desire to make a garden is often followed by a desire to write down your experiences there--in a notebook, or a letter to a friend who gardens, or if, like me, you make your living by words, in a book.

He lives in New Haven, Connecticut.Lavishly produced (with 122 color plates, 300 drawings and 50 black-and-white illustrations), this book, designed to accompany a traveling exhibition, is narrowly focused on the opulent lifestyle and ideology of the Maya ruling elite. Maya history is presented mainly in terms of the sumptuary art, dynastic succession and peculiar (sadomasochistic) courtly rituals of these aristocrats. Schele and Miller see as the keys to this civilization an underworld myth (the Popol Vuh) and grisly blood-letting and -taking ceremonies conducted in royal precincts, parade grounds, ball courts and battlefields, which are pictured on relief carvings and paintings. This interpretation is based on a new phonetic reading of Maya hieroglyphics that has gained ground since the 1960s, to which Schele has contributed heavily. She has come up with eyecatching decipherments of glyphs on monuments that identify the names, dates and some major eventsbirth, death, marriage, accession, the capture of enemiesin the lives of individual Maya kings. Much of this intriguing explication is clearly laid out in the text, captions and notes. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The prince and Betty</h2><p>Lang:- eng, Pages 332.

Twelve years later, Stein moved his operations west to Beverly Hills and hired Lew Wasserman. From his meager beginnings as a movie-theater usher in Cleveland, Wasserman ultimately ascended to the post of president of MCA, and the company became the most powerful force in Hollywood, regarded with a mixture of fear and awe. <br><br>In his signature black suit and black knit tie, Was-serman took Hollywood by storm. He shifted the balance of power from the studios&#x2014;which had seven-year contractual strangleholds on the stars&#x2014;to the talent, who became profit partners. When an antitrust suit forced MCA&#x2019;s evolution from talent agency to film- and television-production company, it was Wasserman who parlayed the control of a wide variety of entertainment and media products into a new type of Hollywood power base. There was only Washington left to conquer, and conquer it Wasserman did, quietly brokering alliances with Democratic and Republican administrations alike. <br><br>That Wasserman&#x2019;s reach extended from the underworld to the White House only added to his mystique. Among his friends were Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa, mob lawyer Sidney Korshak, and gangster Moe Dalitz&#x2014;along with Presidents Johnson, Clinton, and especially Reagan, who enjoyed a particularly close and mutually beneficial relationship with Wasserman. He was equally intimate with Hollywood royalty, from Bette Davis and Jimmy Stewart to Steven Spielberg, who began his career at MCA and once described Wasserman&#x2019;s eyeglasses as looking like two giant movie screens.<br><br>The history of MCA is really the history of a revolution. Lew Wasserman ushered in the Hollywood we know today. He is the link between the old-school moguls with their ironclad studio contracts and the new industry defined by multimedia conglomerates, power agents, multimillionaire actors, and profit sharing. In the hands of Connie Bruck, the story of Lew Wasserman&#x2019;s rise to power takes on an almost Shakespearean scope. <i>When Hollywood Had a King</i> reveals the industry&#x2019;s greatest untold story: how a stealthy, enterprising power broker became, for a time, Tinseltown&#x2019;s absolute monarch.</p><p>From <i>When Hollywood Had a King<br></i><br>On Lew Wasserman:<br>&#x201c;He helped me become president, he helped me stay president, he helped me be a better president.&#x201d; &#x2014;Bill Clinton<br><br>&#x201c;If Hollywood was Mount Olympus, Lew Wasserman is Zeus.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jack Valenti<br><br>&#x201c;At a time when the general image of business executives is not sterling, Lew Wasserman is the gold standard.&#x201d; &#x2014;Barry Diller<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a very simple man.&#x201d; &#x2014;Lew Wasserman, to President Lyndon Baines JohnsonConnie Bruck has been a staff writer at <i>The New Yorker</i> since 1989; she frequently writes about business and politics.

Follow along into Wolfe's famed West Thirty-fifth Street brownstone, where the corpulent orchid-tending genius devours meals, books, and murderers with a passion - and where this time he gets the chance to send a writer's killer to the pen.<br>Charles Childress, the author tapped to continue the beloved Sergeant Barnstable detective stories when the originator died, may not have been the most gifted writer in the world, but he did have his talents...Contentious, combative, and exceedingly vengeful, Childress had an unsurpassed way of making enemies. Which is why, when the police write off his death as suicide, his publisher, Horace Vinson, comes to Nero Wolfe. Vinson knows all too well that in the cutthroat world of publishing, the competition can be murder.<br>Wolfe, however; is not so easily convinced...or distracted from his more genteel pursuits. After all, the evidence does conform to the official version of the killing: The gun found at the crime scene not only belonged to the victim but bore only his fingerprints. Perhaps Childress finally contrived a successful climax...as the author of his own death.<br>But Archie Goodwin, Wolfe's ever-faithful friend and partner; points out that Vinson's fee would keep the big man in beer and bouillabaisse for some time to come. That is a reality Nero Wolfe can't refuse, and soon Archie is posing questions that turn up a whole cast of character assassins, including Childress's ex-editor and agent, his most scathing critic, and his icily beautiful, ambitious fiancee - each of whom would have taken great pleasure in writing the final chapter in the life of Charles Childress.<br>And then, in a plot twist any auteur would envy, Archie gets wind of the involvement of a mysterious kissing cousin from Childress's past. Could this be a case of a small-town girl come to right an old wrong? It's a conundrum so novel even the reluctant Nero Wolfe can't resist...as extortion, deceit, and jealousy come together in a perfect potboiler of revenge - and murder.</p><p>Robert Goldsborough (b. 1937) is an American author best known for continuing Rex Stout&#x2019;s famous Nero Wolfe series. Born in Chicago, he attended Northwestern University, and upon graduation went to work for the Associated Press, beginning a lifelong career in journalism that would include long periods at the Chicago Tribune and Advertising Age. While at the Tribune, Goldsborough began writing mysteries in the voice of Rex Stout, the creator of iconic sleuths Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin. Goldsborough&#x2019;s first novel starring Wolfe, Murder in E Minor (1986), was met with acclaim both from critics and devoted fans, winning a Nero Award from the Wolfe Pack. Six more novels followed, including Death on Deadline (1987) and Fade to Black (1990). In 2005, Goldsborough published Three Strikes You&#x2019;re Dead, the first in an original series starring Chicago Tribune reporter Snap Malek. His most recent novel is Terror at the Fair (2011).Life imitates art imitates life. In his seventh Nero Wolfe/Archie Goodwin caper, the writer responsible for continuing the noted series after the death of originator Rex Stout plots a case around the corpse of an author who has continued a mystery series after the original writer's demise. A publisher hires Wolfe and Goodwin to investigate the death, labeled a suicide, of Charles Childress, an ill-tempered author who had recently angered several people, including his agent, his editor and the possibly corrupt reviewer who had lambasted the latest Childress novel. Yet for all that, Childress also had a pretty fiancee, a loyal friend in a fellow author and the devotion of many fans. Goldsborough carefully draws Wolfe and company into the '90s (computers figure in the plot and hold records of Wolfe's beloved orchids), yet the corpulent sleuth still abandons himself to Fritz Brenner's high-fat meals. As always, Archie does the legwork, which in this instance takes him to rural Indiana, Childress's home state, to unearth secrets that Wolfe pieces together in an assured and effective conclusion. Goldsborough ( Fade to Black ) may not recruit new fans to the anachronistic and bulky Wolfe, but he's likely to satisfy the old Rex Stout faithful. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Beneath The Underdog (Canons)</h2><p><p><i>Charles Mingus is a musician, a mongrel musician who plays beautiful, who plays ugly, who plays lovely, who plays masculine, who plays feminine, who plays all sounds, loud, soft, unheard sounds, sounds, sounds, sounds . . .</i></p><p><i>Beneath the Underdog </i>is the memoir of the Angry Man of jazz, Charles Mingus - the genius whose adventures began at the feet of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Charlie Parker, and led him on a tour of every bottle, bar and bed in the world. </p><p> An unparalleled self-portrait of an artist, <i>Beneath the Underdog </i>is a tour as dizzying, otherworldly, raging and sexy as the man and his music.</p></p><p></p><h2>Bosch</h2><p><strong>From heaven to hell</strong> &nbsp; If <strong>Hieronymus Bosch </strong>(1450-1516) remains an enigma today, it is little wonder. Even his contemporaries found the Netherlandish painter&#x2019;s work difficult to decipher&#x2014;and it still presents riddles to contemporary art historians.&nbsp;Part of the problem in analyzing his shocking and richly allegorical paintings is that virtually nothing is known of the artist himself, apart from his birthplace. There is no record of his life or training, no personal letters, diaries or notebooks, and no contemporary insights into his personality or his thoughts on the meaning of his art. Even his date of birth can only be guessed at, and that based on a drawing assumed to be a self-portrait, made shortly before his death in 1516, which supposedly shows the artist in his late sixties. Bosch remains as mysterious as the worlds he painted.&nbsp;Although rooted in the Old Netherlandish tradition, Bosch developed a highly subjective, richly suggestive formal language. With a mixture of religious humility and satanic wit, he illustrated both the joys of heaven and the cruelly imaginative tortures of hell. In his pictorial world teeming with surrealistic nightmares, the medieval imagination catches fire in a moment of final brilliance before succumbing to humanism and modern rationalism. Though the man himself remains a mystery, this book pulls together the elusive threads of Bosch&#x2019;s work into a cohesive and comprehensive analysis of his work and methods. &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Art series features:<ul> <li>a detailed chronological summary of the life and oeuvre of the artist, covering his or her cultural and historical importance</li> <li>a concise biography</li> <li>approximately 100 illustrations with explanatory captions</li> </ul></p><p></p><h2>Alas, Babylon</h2><p><p>The classic apocalyptic novel that stunned the world.</p></p><p>Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.<p>"Alas, Babylon."

In his new book the author examines a host of techno-trivia questions -- how the fork got its tines, why Scotch tape is called that, how the paper clip evolved, how the Post-it note came to be, how the zipper was named, why aluminum cans have hollow bottoms -- and provides us with answers that both astonish and challenge the imagination.<br><br>In addition to an extended discussion of knives, forks, spoons, and other common devices, the author explains how the interplay of social and technical factors affects the development and use of such things as plastic bags, fast-food packaging, push-button telephones, and other modern conveniences. Throughout the book familiar objects serve to illustrate the general principles behind the evolution of all products of invention and engineering.<br><br>Petroski shows, by way of these examples as well as a probing look at the patent process, that the single most important driving force' behind technological change is the failure of existing devices to live up to their promise. As shortcomings become evident and articulated, new and "improved" versions of artifacts come into being through long and involved processes variously known as research and development, invention, and engineering. He further demonstrates how the evolving forms of technology generally are altered by our very, use of them, and how they, in turn, alter our social and cultural behavior.<br><br>In this wonderful mixture of history, biography, and design theory, Henry Petroski brings us to an understanding of an essential question: By what mechanism do the shapes and forms of our made world come to be?</p><p>This surprising book may appear to be about the simple things of life--forks, paper clips, zippers--but in fact it is a far-flung historical adventure on the evolution of common culture. To trace the fork&#39;s history, Duke University professor of civil engineering Henry Petroski travels from prehistoric times to Texas barbecue to Cardinal Richelieu to England&#39;s Industrial Revolution to the American Civil War--and beyond. Each item described offers a cultural history lesson, plus there&#39;s plenty of engineering detail for those so inclined."Very engaging and wonderfully informative...The Pencil unfolds a history of invention, craftsmanship, engineering, manufacture and business that is also at times a history of cultural life on both sides of the Atlantic...No reader of this book will ever be able to pick up a pencil again without marveling."<p>-- Hilton Kramer, Newsday</p><p>"So engrossing that I read it through in one sitting...An utterly absorbing history."</p><p>-- Martin Gardner, Raleigh News and Observer</p><p>"Beguiling...surprising, entertaining, informative. One could scarcely ask a book to be more!...Using the story of the pencil as a paradigm, Petroski shows us how the process of engineering unfolds and [how] the pencil is the end result of a process that parallels those by which products of much greater sophistication -- computers, for example -- are invented, designed, manufactured and improved."</p><p>-- Jonathan Yardley, Washington Post Book World</p><p>"A serious and charming history...Petroski argues his case with wry humor and an amplitude of anecdotage drawn from many centuries and continents. The Pencil is that great rarity, a book that will appeal to ordinary readers and yet seems destined as well to become a minor classic in academe."</p><p>-- Cullen Murphy, The Atlantic</p><p>"You will never feel the same about the pencil after you read this terrific book."</p><p>-- Larry King, USA Today</p></p><h2>The NURTURE ASSUMPTION: WHY CHILDREN TURN OUT THE WAY THEY DO</h2><p>How much credit do parents deserve when their children turn out well? How much blame when they turn out badly? This electrifying book explodes some of our deepest beliefs about children and parents and gives us something radically new to put in their place. With eloquence and wit, Judith Harris explains why parents have little power to determine the sort of people their children become. It is what children experience outside the home, in the company of their peers, that matters most. Parents don&#39;t socialize children: children socialize children. Yet we cling to the &#34;nurture assumption,&#34; our unquestioned belief that, aside from their genes, what makes children turn out the way they do is the way their parents bring them up. This assumption is so deeply embedded in our culture that it underlies everything we are taught about rearing children and everything we believe about the emotional hangups of adults. But that doesn&#39;t make it true. Harris looks with a fresh eye at the real lives of real children and shows that the nurture assumption is nothing more than a cultural myth. Why do the children of immigrant parents end up speaking in the language and accent of their peers, not of their parents? Why are twins reared together no more alike than twins raised apart? Why does a boy who spends his first eight years with a nanny and his next ten years in boarding school nevertheless turn out just like his father? The nurture assumption cannot provide an answer to these questions. Judith Harris can. Using examples from folklore and literature as well as from scientific research, Harris shows us the world of childhood in all its richness and complexity. Relationships with parents and siblings are always important, but they vary from culture to culture. One aspect of childhood, however, is universal: the children&#39;s peer group. With a range that extends from the Yanomam� of the Brazilian rainforest to deaf Nicaraguan children learning to communicate for the very first time, Harris demonstrates the power peer groups have in shaping the lives of children. Along the way, we see that many cherished notions -- such as the idea that early mother-child attachments set the pattern for later relationships -- fail to explain what happens to real children, or to a girl named Cinderella, whose miserable home life did not keep her from being a great success in the world outside her cottage. Harris has a message that will change parents&#39; lives: they have been sold a bill of goods. Parenting does not match its widely publicized job description. It is a job in which sincerity and hard work do not guarantee success. Through no fault of their own, good parents sometimes have bad kids. Harris offers parents wise counsel on what they can and cannot do, and relief from guilt for those whose best efforts have somehow failed to produce a happy, well-behaved, self-confident child. The Nurture Assumption is a profound work that brings together insights from psychology, sociology, anthropology, primatology, and evolutionary biology to offer a startling new view of who we are and how we got that way.</p><p>Whether it's musical talent, criminal tendencies, or fashion sense, we humans want to know why we have it or why we don't. What makes us the way we are? Maybe it's in our genes, maybe it's how we were raised, maybe it's a little of both--in any case, Mom and Dad usually receive both the credit and the blame. But not so fast, says developmental psychology writer Judith Rich Harris. While it has been shown that genetics is only partly responsible for behavior, it is also true, Harris asserts, that parents play a very minor role in mental and emotional development. <i>The Nurture Assumption</i> explores the mountain of evidence pointing away from parents and toward peer groups as the strongest environmental influence on personality development. Rather than leaping into the nature vs. nurture fray, Harris instead posits nurture (parental) vs. nurture (peer group), and in her view your kid's friends win, hands down. This idea, difficult as it may be to accept, is supported by the countless studies Harris cites in her breezy, charming prose. She is upset about the blame laid on parents of troubled children and has much to say (mostly negative) about "professional parental advice-givers." Her own advice may be summarized as "guide your child's peer-group choices wisely," but the aim of the book is less to offer guidance than to tear off cultural blinders. Harris's ideas are so thought-provoking, challenging, and potentially controversial that anyone concerned with parenting issues will find <i>The Nurture Assumption</i> refreshing, important, and possibly life-changing. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Judith Rich Harris is a former writer of college textbooks on child development who suddenly realized one day that much of what she had been telling her readers was wrong. She stopped writing textbooks and instead wrote a theoretical article on development; her article recently won an award from the American Psychological Association.

This lengthy biography is a single-volume abridgment of a massive, eight-volume work that took a quarter-century to write. It covers Churchill&#39;s entire life, highlighting not only his exploits during the Second World War, but also his early belief in technology and how it would revolutionize warfare in the 20th century. Churchill learned how to fly a plane before the First World War, and was also involved in the development of both the tank and anti-aircraft defense. But he truly showed his unmatched mettle during his country&#39;s darkest moments: &#34;His finest hour was the leadership of Britain when it was most isolated, most threatened, and most weak; when his own courage, determination, and belief in democracy became at one with the nation,&#34; writes Gilbert. There are several wonderful books available on Churchill, but this is probably the best place to start.Martin Gilbert&#39;s highly-acclaimed &#34;Churchill: A Life is a story of adventure. It follows Winston Churchill from his earliest days to his moments of triumph. Here, the drama and excitement of his story are ever-present, as are his tremendous qualities in peace and war, not least as an orator and as a man of vision. Gilbert gives us a vivid portrait, using Churchill&#39;s most personal letters and the recollections of his contemporaries, both friends and enemies, to go behind the scenes of some of the stormiest and most fascinating political events of our time, dominated by two world wars and culminating in the era of the Iron Curtain.</p><h2>The Hellenistic Age: A Short History (Modern Library Chronicles)</h2><p>The Hellenistic era witnessed the overlap of antiquity&#x2019;s two great Western civilizations, the Greek and the Roman. This was the epoch of Alexander&#x2019;s vast expansion of the Greco-Macedonian world, the rise and fall of his successors&#x2019; major dynasties in Egypt and Asia, and, ultimately, the establishment of Rome as the first Mediterranean superpower.<br><br><i>The Hellenistic Age</i> chronicles the years 336 to 30 BCE, from the days of Philip and Alexander of Macedon to the death of Cleopatra and the final triumph of Caesar&#x2019;s heir, the young Augustus. Peter Green&#x2019;s remarkably far-ranging study covers the prevalent themes and events of those centuries: the Hellenization of an immense swath of the known world&#x2013;from Egypt to India&#x2013;by Alexander&#x2019;s conquests; the lengthy and chaotic partition of this empire by rival Macedonian marshals after Alexander&#x2019;s death; the decline of the<i> </i>polis (city state) as the predominant political institution; and, finally, Rome&#x2019;s moment of transition from republican to imperial rule.<br><br>Predictably, this is a story of war and power-politics, and of the developing fortunes of art, science, and statecraft in the areas where Alexander&#x2019;s coming disseminated Hellenic culture. It is a rich narrative tapestry of warlords, libertines, philosophers, courtesans and courtiers, dramatists, historians, scientists, merchants, mercenaries, and provocateurs of every stripe, spun by an accomplished classicist with an uncanny knack for infusing life into the distant past, and applying fresh insights that make ancient history seem alarmingly relevant to our own times.<br><br>To consider the three centuries prior to the dawn of the common era in a single short volume demands a scholar with a great command of both subject and narrative line.<i> The Hellenistic Age</i> is that rare book that manages to coalesce a broad spectrum of events, persons, and themes into one brief, indispensable, and amazingly accessible survey.</p><p>Peter Green is the James R. Dougherty, Jr., Centennial Professor of Classics Emeritus at the University of Texas at Austin.

The occasion was peculiar and ended tragically. The bridegroom, to begin with, was the bride&#x2019;s uncle&#x2014;in fact, the brother of Philip&#x2019;s powerful but repudiated wife, Olympias, till recently an exile in Epirus, plotting revengeful mischief, but now back in Aegae as mother of the bride. Being on the eve of launching a major invasion of Asia Minor, then a Persian satrapy, Philip characteristically figured that an incestuous dynastic alliance would be a cheaper and easier way of protecting his rear than a time- consuming campaign. Hence the wedding. During the ceremony, the images of the twelve Olympian gods were accompanied, in procession, by one of Philip himself. Thus when, on the second day of the festivities, Philip was assassinated by a member of his own bodyguard as he entered the theater prior to the games, many regarded this as divine punishment for unseemly royal hubris.<br><br>For others, clearly, it was an opportunity not to be missed. The assassin, Pausanias, was pursued and killed&#x2014;thus precluding any interrogation of him&#x2014;by friends of Philip&#x2019;s son and (recently dispossessed) heir, the better-known, but not yet Great, Alexander. One of Philip&#x2019;s most trusted senior nobles, Antipater, took immediate charge, quelled the chaos, presented young Alexander to the Macedonian army assembly, and had him confirmed as successor to the throne before his father&#x2019;s body was cold. From being, at unlikely best, regent in Macedonia while Philip was winning glory on campaign, Alexander now found himself, at one stroke, both king and prospective leader of the long-planned Persian invasion. Regicide, as Elizabeth Carney reminds us, &#x201c;was something of a Macedonian tradition.&#x201d;<br><br>Until the late fall of 338, the year of Philip&#x2019;s great victory over the Greek states at Chaeronea, Alexander remained, as he had been since adolescence, Philip&#x2019;s crown prince and designated successor. In 340, when only sixteen, he had acted as regent while his father was campaigning. He led the successful cavalry charge at Chaeronea, a feat that won him a public acclamation by the army. He and his mother, Olympias, were both included among the family images&#x2014;of gold and ivory, hitherto reserved for divine portraiture&#x2014;in the curious circular edifice that Philip dedicated at Olympia to celebrate his victory. Alexander was also one of the delegates to escort the ashes of the Athenian dead back to Athens (the only time, surprisingly, that he ever went there).<br><br>This was the last official duty he carried out during Philip&#x2019;s lifetime. In the late fall of 338, Philip abruptly repudiated Olympias, cast doubts on Alexander&#x2019;s legitimacy, and announced his intention of marrying a young Macedonian, Cleopatra. Not only was Cleopatra impeccably blue-blooded and ethnic&#x2014;in contrast with Olympias the Epirot&#x2014;but her uncle Attalus, a successful and popular soldier, was married to the daughter of Parmenio, Philip&#x2019;s most trusted general. With Parmenio, he was to command the force securing an advance bridgehead in Asia Minor. Philip&#x2019;s formation of a safe power bloc united by marriage surely bore some relation to the coming campaign. Yet to disinherit, and mortally alienate, the successor he had groomed for almost twenty years&#x2014;and to do so almost immediately before his planned crossing into Asia&#x2014;was the kind of gaffe that Philip, always a canny diplomat, would in the normal course of events never commit. These events, clearly, were anything but normal.<br><br>What, then, were his underlying motives? The wedding feast simply underlined their apparent lunacy. Everyone got drunk. Attalus proposed a toast, a prayer for Philip and Cleopatra to produce a legitimate heir. Alexander, in understandable fury&#x2014;&#x201c;Are you calling us [note the royal &#x201c;we&#x201d;] a bastard?&#x201d;&#x2014;assaulted Attalus. Philip made to attack, not Attalus, but his own son. Drunk, he stumbled and collapsed on the floor, giving Alexander a famous exit line: &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the man who&#x2019;s going to cross from Europe to Asia, and he can&#x2019;t even make it from one couch to the next!&#x201d; The insulted prince, heir- apparent no longer, got his mother away to Epirus and himself took refuge among the Illyrians. Both, predictably, proceeded to stir up frontier trouble.<br><br>Why, with a major campaign ahead of him, should so canny a diplomat as Philip have invited palace mayhem by trashing the long-established royal succession overnight? If we assume that he had not taken leave of his senses but was acting on a rational basis, there is one motive only that could explain his sudden volte-face in the fall of 338: the conviction that Alexander and Olympias were planning his overthrow. Argead history made such a fear look all too plausible. If this was what Philip believed, his actions make good sense: in hindsight, of course, they can be seen as not ruthless enough.<br><br>Was his belief justified? On this, certainty is impossible. But it is not hard to see how such suspicions could have been aroused: Alexander&#x2019;s entire upbringing, especially when assessed in light of his mother&#x2019;s<br><br>inordinate ambitions for him, suggests a pattern of high aims, even higher hubris, and dangerous royal impatience. The boy was encouraged to think of himself as a new Achilles (from whom his mother&#x2019;s family claimed descent). His Homeric ideal was to be &#x201c;a good king and a strong spear-fighter&#x201d; and, perhaps more important, &#x201c;ever to strive to be best, and outstanding above all others&#x201d; (Hom. Il. 3.179, 6.208). Glory and fame, kleos, were to be won by conquest. But Philip, again and again, seemed to be anticipating him. &#x201c;For me,&#x201d; Alexander told his tight-knit circle of friends, &#x201c;he will leave no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world with your aid. . . . What use are possessions to me if I achieve nothing?&#x201d; (Plut. Mor. 179D 1; Alex. 5.2). Worst of all, it was now Philip, not he, who stood ready to invade Asia. The great venture that Alexander had thought of as his own inheritance ever since childhood seemed, like Achilles&#x2019; prize, about to elude him. If he and his mother were in fact planning a coup, now was the time, and his motivation could hardly have been stronger.<br><br>So, literally at the eleventh hour, Alexander of Macedon&#x2014;now King Alexander III&#x2014;came into the full inheritance of which he and his mother had dreamed for so long. Like his father, he assumed power in dangerous circumstances: a baptism of fire. He was young, relatively unknown, and not yet haloed with that extraordinary aura of charisma and achievement that in a few short years would come to define him. His powerful opponents may well have thought they could dispose of this upstart boy without trouble. They were wrong: he showed himself absolutely ruthless from the start and had good reason to be. He knew that both his cousin Amyntas, and Cleopatra&#x2019;s newborn son, Caranus (named, ostentatiously, after the dynasty&#x2019;s mythical founder), represented a direct threat to his rule and had powerful backers.<br><br>Outside Macedonia, too, the situation was volatile. The Thebans expelled their Macedonian garrison. There was trouble in Thrace and the Peloponnese. From Athens, Demosthenes wrote to Parmenio and Attalus in Asia Minor, urging them to rebel, promising Athenian help, and sneering at the new Macedonian king as a mere brainless adolescent. Attalus certainly, and Parmenio very probably, took the bait. Alexander&#x2019;s new kingdom was &#x201c;exposed to great jealousies, dire hatreds, and dangers on every side&#x201d; (Plut. Alex. 11.1). His older advisers, led by Antipater, were all understandably advising him to use caution: to steer clear of tangling with the southern Greek states, to appease the frontier tribes with concessions. No, he told them: if I abate my resolve one iota, all our enemies will be on us at once. The only guarantee of security is courage and daring.<br><br>This, of course (a point he probably felt it preferable not to mention), included at least one assassination mission. Attalus, with or without the support of Athens, was an obvious danger (besides having mortally insulted Alexander), and Alexander had already sent a trusted friend to army headquarters in Asia Minor, officially as a liaison officer but with secret instructions to bring Attalus back alive if possible, otherwise to kill him at the first convenient opportunity and make a deal with Parmenio. Parmenio sized up the young king&#x2019;s record so far, decided to switch sides, and even cooperated over the murder of Attalus, his own son-in-law. But he exacted a stiff price for his support. When Alexander&#x2019;s task force crossed into Asia in the spring of 334, Parmenio was his immediate deputy, and almost every crucial senior command was held by one of his friends or relatives. Not for over five years, and then only by a show trial and assassination, was this stranglehold finally broken.<br><br>Having thus summarily dealt with his domestic problems and given the Greek states a taste of what they were up against, Alexander called a meeting of the Hellenic League at Corinth, where the terms laid down by Philip after his victory at Chaeronea were all reconfirmed in the name of his son. Alexander was elected hegemon in his father&#x2019;s place and captain-general, &#x201c;with unlimited powers,&#x201d; of the forthcoming invasion of Asia, to exact vengeance (so ran the declaration) for Xerxes&#x2019; sacrilegious destruction of Greek temples a century and a half before. The alliance with Macedonia &#x201c;in perpetuity&#x201d; was renewed. The Greek states&#x2014;a little diplomatic irony never came amiss&#x2014;were to be &#x201c;free and independent.&#x336;...</p><h2>100 Gun Ship Victory</h2><p>The 100-Gun Ship Victory (Anatomy of the Ship) Revised Edition Complete With 1/192 Scale Fold-out Plan</p><p>John McKay also co-wrote the 24-gun Frigate Pandora another Conway title.</p><h2>The Fabulous Trashwagon (The Last Open Road)</h2><p>3rd novel in &#34;The Last Open Road&#34; series.</p><p>Cult-classic novelist, championship-winning racer and award-winning motorsports journalist</p><h2>Conversations with Rabbi Small</h2><p>The girl appeared, unannounced, at his cabin door, wanting to know if the Rabbi would convert her to Judaism.

Rabbi Small sets about explaining what it means to be a Jew, ostensibly to Joan, but Aaron is drawn more and more into the conversations on the porch of the rabbi's cabin. George Guidall portrays the rabbi, who is deeply religious, learned and realistic, in an accent with hints of Brooklyn in it. Aaron is intelligent, snappish and wise. Joan is innocent and somewhat clueless but sincere. It's a tribute to Guidall's powers that the listener becomes fond of all three characters and deeply interested in the rabbi's evening discourses.

Brown's 1971 preface, both providing invaluable commentary, Robeson begins with his recollection of a Princeton boyhood. The roots of his world-view that would ultimately be his undoing were set down there. "Throughout his youth, Robeson's father [a pastor in the A.M.E. Zion Church] insisted on 'personal integrity,' which included the idea of 'maximum human fulfillment.'" Indeed, to list Robeson's achievements while attending university is to be in awe of a fabulously endowed man, bent on living out his father's edicts, and achieving his magnificent potential. </p><p> As his fascination with the Soviet Union grew, he began to attract the notice of McCarthy's watchdogs. He had begun to draw parallels between the Soviet social "experiment," which brought a whole underclass into the 20th century, and the emerging nations of Africa. In the early '40s, he reached the height of his performing career ("Robeson's Othello was more authentic than that of any other actor of his time"), but soon thereafter, he would set aside his brilliant career and commit fiercely to the struggle for black liberation. In 1949, it would all come crashing down, and for a decade, an ugly, active campaign against Robeson reigned, stemming not from the growing radicalization of his beliefs, but from the turning tide of cold war politics. W.E.B. DuBois, also a victim of the Communist witch-hunts noted, "He is without doubt today, as a person, the best known American on earth, to the largest number of human beings. His voice is known in Europe, Asia and Africa, in the West Indies and South America and in the islands of the seas. Children on the streets of Peking and Moscow, Calcutta and Jakarta greet him and send him their love. Only in his native land is he without honor and rights." </p><p> Lloyd L. Brown helped Robeson write <i>Here I Stand</i>, and he crafted the tone, which is at once accessible and impassioned, originally aimed at the black religious community. Highly idealistic, passionately exhorting, deeply committed to the "common people," this Paul Robeson gem remains a vital challenge to the racism that still dogs American society. <i>-- Hollis Giammatteo</i></p><b>Paul Leroy Robeson </b>(April 9, 1898 &#x2013; January 23, 1976) was an American concert singer (bass), recording artist, actor, athlete, scholar who was an advocate for the Civil Rights Movement in the first half of the 20th century. He gained international attention for his work in the arts and he merged his artistic career with political activism to speak out for the equality of minorities and the rights of workers throughout the world. His friendship with the Soviet Union and the Soviet peoples plus criticism of the lack of progress in civil rights in the United States at the outset of the Cold War and during the age of McCarthyism brought scrutiny, conflict and retribution from the American government.

Shan Tao Yun, disgraced Beijing investigator and survivor of a Tibetan gulag, now spends his days quietly dwelling among residents of the &#x201c;Roof of the World.&#x201d; Over the years, his intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Chinese political system has proved invaluable in solving a host of compelling conundrums. In this sixth installment (after Prayer of the Dragon, 2007), Shan is transporting a corpse over the slopes of Mt. Everest when he hears gunfire. Two women&#x2014;a Chinese minister and an outspoken American hiker&#x2014;have been shot and left for dead at the side of the road. The Chinese authorities are quick to blame the inhabitants of a local village, who have long harbored animosity toward a government that sees Tibet&#x2019;s majestic mountains as little more than a tourist commodity. Shan questions revered soothsayers and surly colonels in search of answers, ever aware that the survival of his son Ko&#x2014;currently imprisoned in a Chinese asylum&#x2014;depends on his success.

She is the About.com Guide for headaches and Migraine disease, and serves as the National Support Advisor for MAGNUM, the National Migraine Association.</p>In this addition to the "Living Well" series, patient advocate Robert provides current information on headaches and migraine disease, treatments, personal stories and coping techniques. The author, a longtime migraineur, stresses that although many migraine sufferers are unaware of treatment options, at least 95 percent of sufferers can benefit from preventive regimens once correctly diagnosed. Migraines, Robert explains, are not simply bad headaches, but a "genetic neurological disease that flares up when we encounter triggers" and can take many forms-tension, cluster, or rebound, which is brought on by medication overuse-each of which require different treatments. Robert notes new medication developed to treat stroke, seizures and depression are now used for migraine disease, welcome news for sufferers who have for years ridden out migraine attacks with over-the-counter pain medication. She details "trigger" identification and management by listing the many triggers of headaches and migraines, and reviews preventive, "abortive" (which adjust neurotransmittal levels) and complementary therapies. With case studies and examples of patient advocacy, Robert also urges her readers to learn coping skills and to seek support from others, providing a clear overview of her subject with the authority of personal experience and a researcher's determination. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dorr, <i>Chopper</i> features first-hand accounts of the helicopter's evolution in times of war. The only oral history of its kind, filled with photographs, it is a handsome volume that will earn a prominent place on the bookshelves of military history readers.This history of American helicopters in combat manages to be both readable and comprehensive. <i>Comprehensive</i> because it provides not only narratives of operations but also technical data on the machines used in those operations, from Burma in 1944, where early Sikorskis flew, to contemporary Afghanistan, in which late Sikorskis have figured. <i>Readable</i> because it is a series of narratives by actual helicopter operators charged with, for instance, rescuing British wounded and American liaison pilots in Burma, and moving Special Operations troops in Afghanistan. In between are accounts, always accompanied by illustrations of all the hardware, of medevacs in Korea, the seminal consequences of air mobility in Vietnam, and the successive generations of deadly gunships, ending with the Apaches and SuperCobras now serving in southwest Asia.

A man brought in an exhibit of things he'd found while he was restoring an old house. The one that really caught my eye was the head of a ceramic doll. She had no hair, no eyes, and, of course, no body, but her face was beautiful. Her label said, "Antique Doll's head, manufactured in Germany around 1898, dug up in the rose garden." I wondered who buried the doll in the garden and why.

He has since gained enormous popular and critical acclaim for both his mainstream and his science fiction novels.Accompanied by a lengthy essay, "A Few Notes on the Culture" (1997), these seven arresting short stories and the disturbing novella that provides the title for Banks's latest SF collection all date from 1984&#x2013;1987, the period of his bizarre mainstream novel <i>The Wasp Factory </i>and the extravagant genre novel <i>Consider Phlebas, </i>both cult-inspiring works. In short pieces like "Road of Skulls" and "Piece," Banks turns convention upside down and inside out, with shocker-endings that linger like smoke rising from a crematorium. "Odd Attachment" traces a marooned spaceman and his AI suit on a tortuous survival trek across an uninhabited planet, illustrating Banks's preoccupation with the "self-generative belief system" that applies to both humans and AIs in the Culture, the setting for the title story and some of his SF novels. Viewing Earth and <i>Homo sapiens</i> through the eyes of the Culture, a galactic group-civilization spawned by a handful of humanoid species several thousand years in the past, allows Banks to speculate on his dearest philosophical topics: the preferability of anarchy in space, denunciation of market economies as "synthetic evil," never-ending education for both humans and machines, and genetic manipulation. For all their wrenching images and sadistic twists, Banks's unsettling tales bestow a grim gift, the ability to see ourselves as others might see us. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

According to Shuichi Saito, the withdrawn boyfriend of teenager Kirie Goshima, their town is haunted not by a person or being but by a pattern: <i>uzumaki</i>, the spiral, the hypnotic secret shape of the world. It manifests itself in small ways: seashells, ferns, whirlpools in water, whirlwinds in air. And in large ways: the spiral marks on people's bodies, the insane obsessions of Shuichi's father, the voice from the cochlea in your inner ear. As the madness spreads, the inhabitants of Kur�zu-cho are pulled ever deeper, as if into a whirlpool from which there is no return...</p><p><b><br>Junji Ito debuted as a horror manga artist in 1987 with the first story in his successful </b><i>Tomie</i><b> series. </b><i>Uzumaki</i><b>, drawn from 1998 to 1999, was adapted into a live-action movie, which has been released in America by Viz Films and Tidepoint Pictures. It's influences include the classic manga artists Kazuo Umezu and Hideshi Hino, as well as authors Yasutaka Tsutsui and H.P. Lovecraft.<br></b>The townspeople of Kurozu-cho are being haunted by a strange infection of spirals. When corpses are cremated, the smoke forms a black spiral in the sky, and the clouds form swirls like those in Van Gogh's The Starry Night. Soon, things intensify: a lighthouse throws out spiral beams at dusk; babies are born, only to sprout spiral-capped mushroom-shaped appendages from their stomachs; one man becomes obsessed with spirals until he goes completely mad. The spirals even begin to infect people's bodies, leaving grotesque spiral voids. Readers witness these chilling disturbances through Kirie, a wide-eyed schoolgirl with a pixie cut, whose world is drawn in typical, lighthearted teen-romance manga style. When she's at home or school, things seem normal, but the sudden contrasts between the ordinary events of everyday life and this mysterious invasion of chaotic, threatening spirals makes the horror all the more shocking. Ito knows how to make readers' hearts drop and stomachs turn, but once the scare factor wears off there's not much more to the book .Characters enter the story only to become part of the town's body count, and Kirie, a constant survivor, is no more than a vehicle for the next spooky outbreak of deadly spirals. She reacts to each ordeal with fear and manages to escape before the spirals show up yet again. She doesn't attempt to find a solution, and there's barely any character development or plot. Ito's b&amp;w drawings are well done and scary, but the book's essentially an empty thrill. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Holy Bible: The New King James Version (Pew Library Edition)</h2><p><p>The NKJV Pew Bible is updated and improved, yet with the same economical price as before.

Readers then wrote to me of the uncanny timing and coincidences that led them to read it. Whether by word of mouth, or by synchronicity, I am delighted that it is still in print, some twenty years later, and am glad that it now has a Mark Rothko painting on its cover, besides. Synchronistic events in my own life played a significant part in the events that I wrote of in <i>Crossing to Avalon: A Woman's Midlife Pilgrimage</i>. They also contributed to the writing of <i>Close to the Bone: Life-Threatening Illness and the Search for Meaning</i>.A woman dreams about an event which then happens. A man thinks about being out of contact with an old friend; the phone rings and the caller is that friend. Someone experiences sympathetic pains while a relative undergoes surgery.... <p><i>The Tao of Psychology</i> rejects the commonly-held notion that these are interesting, but isolated events. Such uncanny coincidences often bring in their wake an all-too-fleeting awareness of being part of an infinite yet meaningful whole. The Tao of Psychology explores the interrelationship between "meaningful coincidences" and the intuitive sense that we are part of the oneness of the universe. The underlying principle is called Tao in Eastern philosophy and synchronicity in Jungian psychology. Coincidental events which are significant to us and cannot be explained in any rational way are synchronistic. </p><p>Now, Jean Shinoda Bolen, M.D., shows how to apply this important concept to everyday life. She shares her methods of recognizing authentic "meaningful coincidences," shows how they function as "waking dreams" -- compact, symbolistic messages to the consciousness -- and demonstrates her "Agatha Christie approach" to unraveling the meaning of each occurrence. To appreciate a synchronistic event, one needs the ability to note an inner subjective slate, a thought, feeling, vision, dream, or premonition and to intuitively link it with a related outer event. Each synchronistic experience is unique; Dr. Bolen's methods allow the reader to enter this wholly new, individualistic means of experiencing. </p><p><i>The Tao of Psychology</i> also points out how synchronicity operates as the foundation of the Tarot, horoscopes, and--most importantly--the <i>I Ching</i>. By relating the concepts of the Tao and synchronicity, Dr. Bolen reveals important links between Western psychology and Eastern spirituality, right brain and left, the individual and the external world. An understanding of this principle also sheds light on research into parapsychology--especially such areas of ESP as precognition, telepathy, and clairvoyance. </p><p>Synchronistic events can assure us when we are on the right life-path and advise us when we are not; at the most profound level, they reassure us that we are not mere observers, but always participators in an interconnected cosmic web.</p></p><h2>Kitty&#39;s Big Trouble (Kitty Norville)</h2><p><p>Kitty Norville is back and in more trouble than ever. Her recent run-in with werewolves traumatized by the horrors of war has made her start wondering how long the US government might have been covertly using werewolves in combat. Have any famous names in our own history might have actually been supernatural? She's got suspicions about William Tecumseh Sherman. Then an interview with the right vampire puts her on the trail of Wyatt Earp, vampire hunter.</p><p>But her investigations lead her to a clue about enigmatic vampire Roman and the mysterious Long Game played by vampires through the millennia. That, plus a call for help from a powerful vampire ally in San Francisco, suddenly puts Kitty and her friends on the supernatural chessboard, pieces in dangerously active play.

Can you tell me what that is?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ms.... Norville, is it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Kitty Norville,&#x201d; I said, thinking&nbsp;calm. I could wear him down with patience.<br>&#x201c;Ms. Norville&#x2014;can I ask why you want to have General Sherman&#x2019;s body exhumed?&#x201d;<br>General William T. Sherman, hero of the Civil War on the Union side, war criminal on the Confederate side, considered one of the greatest soldiers and strategists in American history, and all-around icon. And yeah, I wanted to dig him up. It was a little hard to explain, and I hesitated, trying to figure out what to say. Last week I&#x2019;d received a package from the Library of Congress containing a copy of an interview transcript from the 1930s. It had been made as part of the Federal Writers&#x2019; Project, a New Deal program that employed journalists and other writers to record local histories around the country. Many valuable stories were collected and preserved as part of the program. The one I&#x2019;d been sent was an interview with a Civil War veteran&#x2014;one of the last to survive, no doubt. He&#x2019;d been sixteen when he joined the Confederate army in the middle of the war and was close to ninety when he&#x2019;d been interviewed, and he claimed that he&#x2019;d witnessed General Sherman transform into a wolf during the Battle of Vicksburg. A librarian who was also a listener and fan of my radio show discovered it and sent it to me. I had always had my suspicions about Sherman&#x2014;he looked so rough and tumble in his photos, with his unbuttoned collar, his unkempt beard, and a &#x201c;screw you&#x201d; expression. If any Civil War general had been a werewolf, it would be Sherman. But was my hunch and a single interview proof? No. Which was why I wanted to exhume the body, to test any remaining tissue for the presence of lycanthropy.<br>Maybe it was best to lay it out there. &#x201c;I think General Sherman may have been a werewolf and I want to run tests on his remains to find out.&#x201d;<br>Of course, a long pause followed. I kept waiting for the click of a phone hanging up, which would have been fine; I&#x2019;d have just called one of the other numbers on my list. I hadn&#x2019;t expected this to be easy.<br>&#x201c;Seriously?&#x201d; he said finally. The same way he might have said, You&#x2019;re eating&nbsp;bugs?<br>&#x201c;Yeah. Seriously. So how about it? Don&#x2019;t you want to help me rewrite American history?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, could I get your name one more time?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Could you spell it for me? And tell me where you&#x2019;re calling from?&#x201d;<br>I felt a restraining order coming on. So in the end, I was the one who hung up.<br>Oh well. You can&#x2019;t win them all.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>AT HOME that evening I sat on the sofa, library books lying open on the coffee table next to me and my laptop screen showing a half dozen Web sites open. I was supposed to be researching Sherman. Instead, I was reading through the transcript for what must have been the twentieth time.<br>Tom Hanson had enlisted in the Confederate army at the age of sixteen. At several points during the interview he mentioned how young he&#x2019;d been. How innocent, and how foolish. The interviewer kept having to prompt him to return to the focus of the story, his encounter with General Sherman under the light of the full moon.<br>One night while his squad was on patrol outside of Vicksburg, Hanson had gotten separated from the others and lost his way in the swampy forest some distance from where the Confederates were camped. Trying to find his way back, he&#x2019;d stumbled across a pair of Union soldiers&#x2014;an enlisted man arguing with an officer. The enlisted soldier kept calling the other man &#x201c;General,&#x201d; and Hanson swore the officer was General William Sherman himself. He couldn&#x2019;t explain the argument because it hadn&#x2019;t made any sense to him&#x2014;the enlisted man was telling the general that he&#x2019;d overstepped his bounds, and that he wanted to challenge him. Hanson had heard that Sherman was crazy&#x2014;he could understand anyone on the Union side wanting him out of command. But that wasn&#x2019;t up to an enlisted man, and they certainly wouldn&#x2019;t have been discussing it in the middle of a swamp.<br>Hanson didn&#x2019;t understand it, but he described what happened next. &#x201c;The general, he took his clothes off. I couldn&#x2019;t move or he&#x2019;d&#x2019;ve heard me, so I didn&#x2019;t dare. I just sat there and watched. So there he was, naked in the moonlight. And then he changed. Like his body just melted, and I heard his bones snapping. I can&#x2019;t say that I ever saw a wolf before, but that&#x2019;s what he turned into&#x2014;big, shaggy, with yellow eyes. That other soldier, well&#x2014;he just ran. Didn&#x2019;t do him any good. That big ol&#x2019; wolf chased him down.&#x201d;<br>The door to the condo opened and closed&#x2014;my husband, Ben, lawyer and fellow werewolf&#x2014;arriving home. He set his briefcase near the desk of his home office, a corner of the living room, and regarded me where I sat on the sofa, papers on my lap, my head bent in concentration.<br>&#x201c;Still on that transcript?&#x201d; he said, his smile amused.<br>I sighed. Ben had seen me reading it every night this week, searching for some insight. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fascinating, isn&#x2019;t it? What if it isn&#x2019;t just a story? What if he&#x2019;s right?&#x201d; I pulled one of the books over, referring to a timeline of Sherman&#x2019;s life. &#x201c;Did you know that early on in the war Sherman had a nervous breakdown? He was relieved of duty, and the newspapers and everyone said he was crazy, that he couldn&#x2019;t take the pressure. But he recovered and when he came back he was this badass general. He and Grant started kicking ass and eventually Sherman marched the Union army through Georgia and won the war. What if that&#x2019;s when it happened? Somehow he got attacked and infected around the Battle of Bull Run, it knocked him for a loop, he took time off to deal with it, and when he came back he was a super soldier. A werewolf general.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I suppose it&#x2019;s possible,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But if you&#x2019;re right, he kept it really well hidden.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lots of people keep it really well hidden,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m betting it was easier to keep it hidden then than it is now.&#x201d;<br>He sat on the sofa beside me, which was too tempting an invitation. I leaned toward him, pulling his arm over my shoulder and snuggling against him. As I hoped, he hugged me close and bent his head to my hair, breathing in my scent as I took in his. Our wolf sides, claiming each other.<br>I said, &#x201c;I just keep thinking&#x2014;who else is out there? What secret histories slipped through the cracks because people kept it hidden or no one believed it? I&#x2019;m not talking about Vlad Tepes being Dracula. What if Sherman really was a werewolf? Who else might have been werewolves? Maybe there was a reason Rasputin was so hard to kill, and Jack the Ripper was so bloodthirsty&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>He stopped me with a kiss, which was okay with me. I touched his cheeks and smiled.<br>&#x201c;What would it change?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If Sherman really was a werewolf, would it really change anything?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d know the truth.&#x201d;<br>He looked skeptical. It was a fair question. Did this mean any more than slapping labels on people? In Sherman&#x2019;s case, it meant a reinterpretation of his history&#x2014;his nervous breakdown looked a whole lot different if he was a werewolf. But even that was speculation. He might have been infected with lycanthropy years before.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t just the labels. It meant history had a whole other layer to it, and that supernatural beings might have played an active role in guiding human events for centuries. I could almost get conspiracy minded about it.<br>&#x201c;How can you even confirm something like this for sure? In a way that would hold up in court?&#x201d; he added. Always legal-minded.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been trying to find out how to get his body exhumed&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>He looked at me. &#x201c;You&nbsp;haven&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Um, yeah. It&#x2019;s a lot harder than I thought it would be.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course it is. You can&#x2019;t just go around digging up graves. Especially famous ones.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said, wincing. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You need to find a vampire who knew him,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Get a corroborating eyewitness account from someone who wasn&#x2019;t a scared teenager confronting a guy like Sherman.&#x201d;<br>He probably meant it as a joke, but I turned thoughtful.<br>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I could probably do that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Honey, if anyone...</p><h2>67 prizewinning plywood projects: From eight years of the Popular science design competition</h2><p>Award winning projects,no DJ light brown cloth covers. on hardboard.</p><p></p><h2>Montana Atlas and Gazetteer (Montana Atlas &amp; Gazetteer)</h2><p>95 detailed color topographic maps.

As the magnificent houses here show, each of Wright's buildings was a complex composition of many interrelated elements; he regarded them as symphonies. Wright designed not just the shell, but everything inside as well: furniture, skylights, art glass windows, light fixtures, textiles, carpets, wall murals, decorative accessories, even the landscaping. <br> Illustrating how Wright affected and inspired other houses, <i>The Wright Style</i> also presents interpretations of Wright's principles by some of his followers and apprentices providing a guided walk through a century of his unsurpassed influence on design. And for those who love Wright but who cannot live in complete, authentic rooms or purchase antique Wright furnishings, the book's catalogue of products makes it possible at least to bring a touch of the Wright style home. <br> "Wright's ideas have so permeated our architectural world that we have lost track of the source," writes author Carla Lind. "His open floor plans led to family rooms, kitchens open to living areas, indoor spaces open to outdoor living spaces, garden rooms, decks, and carports. His use of glass opened window walls and brought generous amounts of light and inspiring vistas into rooms. He altered America's collective subconscious. By bringing together many elements and inspirations, most neither new nor original, he was able to synthesize fresh new forms that reflected the character of the nation."</p><p><b>Carla Lind,</b> author of <i>Lost Wright</i> and the Wright at a Glance series, has worked to preserve Frank Lloyd Wright's buildings for more than two decades. She has directed the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio Foundation and the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy as well as the restoration of Wright's May house in Grand Rapids, Michigan.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>THE WRIGHT STYLE<br><br>Frank Lloyd Wright's Architecture Was Rooted In Nature; He Called it Organic. At the Heart of His Work Was Simplicity, Harmony, Unity, and Integrity. He Tossed Out Our Boxlike Spaces, Forever Changing the Idea of What a House Could Be.<br><br><b>ORIGINS</b><br><br>There is a certain irony in talking about a "Wright style," because the uniformity this term implies probably would be viewed negatively by Wright himself. To Wright, the inherent differences in each building, designed to fit the needs of each client and the attributes of each site, defied grouping it into a category. The only "style" involved was how well a building was designed to serve its own purpose. Wright suggested that "as humanity develops, there will be less recourse to the 'styles' and more style...that quality in each that was once painfully achieved by the whole." His own work clearly reflected this attitude. Each Wright-designed structure was unique and vital. That was <i>his</i> style. Yet there is an undeniable commonality about the vast number of designs that burst forth from this artistic genius.<br><br>Frank Lloyd Wright's creations were based on a life philosophy that was undeniably rooted in his childhood. Further shaped by his life experiences, his designs developed distinct attributes that, when repeated, pushed some of his buildings helplessly into sub-styles such as Prairie (1901-1913), textile block (1917-1924), and Usonian (1936-1959), terms used by Wright himself. While useful, these terms do not do justice to the individuality of each building, and they do not describe many of his designs that cannot be neatly labeled. Like any great artist, his work has been grouped into periods to denote shifts in his personal and professional direction. Such categories, like his buildings, are not boxes; instead, they are open and informal shelters. Wright called the totality of his work organic architecture. This concept provides the breadth and flexibility required to define Wright's style as he and his followers have practiced it for the past century. It is far more enduring than the term "style" implies.<br><br>To Wright, standardization was useful but should not limit the architect's vision. In fact, his fascination with technology and his desire to bring good design into the homes of average Americans led to several production-line projects, for prefabricated houses, glassware, fabrics, wallpapers, and furniture. By agreeing to design lines of interior furnishings, he was certainly selling his "style," because for the most part they would not be used in buildings he designed.<br><br>Many fibers in Wright's life were woven together to create a unified, ideological tapestry just as all of the elements in his buildings were combined and interrelated to yield a complete composition for living. Wright acknowledged that some of the fibers contributed more to the ultimate fabric than others.<br><br><b>UNITY</b><br><br>The origins of Frank Lloyd Wright's aesthetic sensitivity can be traced to his youth. His mother, Anna Lloyd Wright, the child of tough, Unitarian, Welsh farmers, introduced her son to many of the experiences that shaped his life. Anna Lloyd-Jones was raised in the Wisconsin River Valley near Spring Green, Wisconsin, and she loved the earth. Wright described her as being "in league with the stones of the field." Anna had a vision for her son -- that he would become a great architect. Thus, his early education, at home and at school, was directed toward this goal. She provided a simple but stimulating environment for his learning. Her maternal influence was augmented by the dominating Lloyd-Jones family. Wright frequently visited the Wisconsin farms of his uncles and learned firsthand about hard work, simplicity, and self-confidence.<br><br>The concept of unity was a compelling early lesson. So intrinsic was it to the Unitarianism of his family that it must have played an indelible role in creating his world view. As he recalled in his autobiography, "Unity was their watchword, the sign and symbol that thrilled them, the Unity of all things!" Wright's grandfather, father, and uncles were powerful preachers who pounded the concepts of their faith into the depths of the soul of the child. Unity -- a oneness with the world, with God, with all forms of life. Truth, truth above all, truth against the world, the beauty of truth. This refrain also echoed in Wright's young world. How could these concepts be forgotten as he forged his own philosophy? They could not. They became its foundation.<br><br><b>MUSIC</b><br><br>Wright's father made a lasting impact on the architect's aesthetics, although some historians have considered him, unlike Wright's mother, an insignificant and somewhat temporary influence. Like the Lloyd-Jones family, William Russell Cary Wright also was a Unitarian, a minister as well as a lawyer and musician. From him, Wright discovered his passion for Baroque music. As a child, he would lay awake listening to his father playing Beethoven on the piano. The interplay of the notes, the minor themes and major themes, the harmony, the building, the movement from general to particulars, all deeply affected the way he viewed his world. Music did not merely entertain him but also enriched his life in many ways. It provided an analogous system that he could use to help translate his ideas into another art form, architecture. In his autobiography, Wright described the commonalities between an architect and a musician: "the striving for entity, oneness in diversity, depth in design, repose in the final expression of the whole. I am going to a delightful inspiring school when I listen to Beethoven's music."<br><br>In a special edition of <i>House Beautiful</i> magazine published in 1955, Wright, then eighty-eight, wrote:<br><br><b>What I call integral ornament is founded upon the same organic simplicities as Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, that amazing revolution in tumult and splendor of sound built upon four tones, based upon a rhythm a child could play on the piano with one finger. Supreme imagination reared the four repeated tones, simple rhythms, into a great symphonic poem that is probably the noblest thought-built edifice in our world. And architecture is like music in this capacity for the symphony.</b><br><br>To Wright, both music and architecture were sublimated mathematics. He credited his father with making the comparison by referring to a symphony as an "edifice of sound."<br><br><b>NATURE</b><br><br>Nature, above all else, was Wright's most inspirational force. He advised his students to "study nature, love nature, stay close to nature. It will never fail you." His childhood experiences on the family homesteads in the rugged, driftless area of southwestern Wisconsin put him in touch with the rhythms, patterns, colors, and systems of nature. The simple concept of the interdependence of all living things was absorbed at an early age. Nature was synonymous with God to Wright, and it was his greatest teacher. Through his mother, Wright also learned to appreciate the work of the naturalist writers of the time: Whittier, Lowell, Emerson, Blake, and Thoreau. Their writings encouraged him to find wisdom in the natural world.<br><br>In 1953, in one of his Sunday morning spontaneous talks to his students, Wright advised them:<br><br><b>The place for an architect to study construction first of all, before he gets into the theory of the various formulas that exist in connection with steel beams, girders, and reinforced concrete, is the study of Nature. In Nature you will find everything exemplified, from the blade of grass to the tree, from the tree to the geological formations to the procession of the eras beginning with the first from the sea downwards....<br><br>That doesn't mean you are to go out and just look at the hills and the ways the animals conduct themselves....The study of Nature, Nature with a capital N, Nature, inner Nature, Nature of the hand, of this apparatus, of this glass. The truth concerning all those things is architectural study.</b><br><br>He did not suggest copying nature but, instead, allowing it to be an inspiration, understanding the fundamental principles and elements -- its essence. The visual delights that nature provides became a part of his designs as well. The sympathetic relationship between site and building, the easy transitions from the inside to the outside, the gardens and planters all illustrate a respect for the natural world that is compelling. It is difficult to visit one of Wright's buildings and not interact, in a memorable way, with its setting. He built homes around trees, rather than remove them. He used the sun's power to help warm the rooms and provide an ever-changing pattern of light and shadow. He framed views, both nearby and distant. He borrowed nature's devices to provide repose using the line of the horizon, to extend reach using the cantilever like a branch, to create protective shelter like a natural cave. The interplay of people, building, and site was harmonious and masterful.<br><br><b>GEOMETRY</b><br><br>As a result of Anna Lloyd Wright's continuous search for educational techniques that would encourage young Frank's creative skills, she discovered the Froebel blocks. These teaching tools for Friedrich Froebel's kindergarten education program introduced Wright to geometry, spatial relationships, and systems in a fundamental way. The program's basic theme was that child's play could be gently guided, using specific techniques, toward a greater appreciation for the elements and laws of nature. The tools were simple, pure shapes, unlike the gawdy, frivolous toys of the period.<br><br>It is from the Froebel "gifts," as they were called, that he learned the basic forms of nature -- geometric forms -- in two and three dimensions. First, he worked with colored yarn shapes, then smooth maple blocks in cubes, spheres, and triangles, then colorful cardboard shapes made into patterns on a tabletop grid. Each exercise was a new problem that challenged the budding designer. As a child, he spent hours with these gifts, later attributing to them a formative and lasting influence on his architecture. Their impact was apparent in every building Wright ever designed.<br><br>From nature and elemental geometry grew Wright's ability to abstract natural forms -- reducing a flower or leaf to pure geometric shapes. This pattern could then be manipulated in various combinations into a new composition. These geometric exercises became the sources of floor plans, elevations, and decorative arts, each element generated from the same design theme. Once converted into three-dimensional forms, the elements would all work together in harmony like the natural shapes that were their source. Each building was given its own lexicon of forms, a language then used throughout the design. The art glass related to the furniture, which related to the moldings, which related to the floor plan, which related to the site plan. They became inextricably linked through geometry.<br><br>0 Abstracted natural motifs were used for art glass window designs in the early houses. Sometimes, a specific plant was selected, such as the tulip in the 1895 playroom of his own home in Oak Park or the sumac in the Dana-Thomas house of 1904. But in other commissions, such as the May house of 1908 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a more generic plant form appears to be the source.<br><br>A thematic, geometric design was cast into the concrete blocks that Wright first introduced in California about 1920. In the Freeman house alone are fifty-two versions of the block design, which apparently is based on an abstraction of the site plan with a grove of eucalyptus. The variations of this basic design were repeated over and over and when massed into walls create a pattern and rhythm of their own.<br><br>In 1936 Wright designed his first Usonian house, a word he used to describe buildings uniquely suitable for life in the United States. In these houses, the abstractions are even clearer than in his early Prairie Style designs. Each home was based on a geometric grid used both in plan and in elevation. The two-by-four-foot rectangular module of the first Jacobs residence in Madison, Wisconsin, was drawn on the architectural plans as well as scored into the concrete floor. The module, or unit of design, selected for a particular building would twist and turn and be repeated over and over in the floor plan and elevations. Squares, hexagons, circles, parallelograms, and triangles also were used at different times as the basis for building designs.<br><br><b>LOUIS SULLIVAN</b><br><br>Wright moved to Chicago from his native Wisconsin in 1887, leaving the University of Wisconsin after only two semesters. He first apprenticed with Joseph Lyman Silsbee, who was actively introducing the Shingle Style to the Midwest. Within a year, Wright began his tenure at the side of Louis Sullivan, whom he would thereafter refer to as his <i>lieber Meister</i> (beloved master). Sullivan also inspired Wright to look at nature's rhythms and processes and to create architecture that related to contemporary life. Sullivan, the philosophical father of what became known as the Prairie School, provided the rhetoric that called for an American architecture that was not bound by tradition. More practically, he taught Wright about ornament. Rather than applied, he believed, it should be integral to the building itself. Wright learned from Sullivan that the elements of a building could provide all of the ornamentation that was needed. Again the refrain that governed Wright's work -- simplicity, unity, nature.<br><br><b>JAPANESE DESIGN</b><br><br>Wright also was profoundly influenced by Japanese design. His first exposure was the imperial Japanese exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. Known as the Ho-ho-den, its fluid spaces were covered by a broad, sheltering roof, with generous overhanging eaves. Light poured in from all sides. The walls moved, opening up spaces, releasing the box. This experience provided more data for Wright's creative mind to devour and synthesize.<br><br>The simplicity of Japanese design also revealed itself in Japanese wood-block prints, which combined his love of nature and the pureness of geometry. His fascination with them began as a young man. When he and his first wife, Catherine, visited Japan for the first time in 1905, he was able to study Japanese architecture and roam the back alleys in search of prints. At various times in his life, his impressive collection of Japanese art was sold to pay debts, and at other periods it grew to include screens, kimonos, ceramics, and textiles. But the print remained as a symbol of simplicity and elimination of all that was unnecessary. This quality provided such a pivotal impact on his design aesthetic that he published his first book, <i>The Japanese Print,</i> on the subject in 19 10.<br><br><b>ORGANIC ARCHITECTURE</b><br><br>Through years of careful, intuitive observation, study, and experimentation, Wright was able to translate his unique concept of architecture into a total design ideology that he called organic architecture. He welcomed opportunities to articulate this ideology in lectures and publications throughout his life. Perhaps the act of organizing his thoughts and communicating them so frequently helped instill them so securely in his own behavior that the architectural consistency was sure to follow -- it may have been the synthesizing process that pulled it all together. His work embodied his ideals. He truly created a new architectural language.<br><br>In 1894, at age twenty-seven, he is thought to have conceived a famous essay, "In the Cause of Architecture," that was ultimately published in <i>The Architectural Record</i> in 1908. In the essay, he set forth propositions that established an endu...</p><h2>The Complete Cook&#39;s Country TV Show Cookbook 10th Anniversary Edition: Every Recipe and Every Review From All Ten Seasons (COMPLETE CCY TV SHOW COOKBOOK)</h2><p>The Complete Cook&#39;s Country TV Show Cookbook captures all ten seasons of the show into one colorful volume that&#39;s like a treasured recipe box brought to life.

Reprint.</p><p>The <i>Strong Women</i> have done it again. First <i>Strong Women Stay Young</i> broke new ground by showing women how strength training--exercising with weights or against resistance--can delay the signs of aging. Then <i>Strong Women Stay Slim</i> showed women how strength training could keep the pounds off. Now <i>Strong Women, Strong Bones</i> teaches women how to prevent and treat osteoporosis through exercise (strength training, weight-bearing aerobic exercise, stretching, and balance) and nutrition. Tufts University researcher Miriam Nelson and award- winning health writer Sarah Wernick again team up to bring you the latest science, translated to reader-friendly language and practical application. You learn how osteoporosis works, your personal risk factors, and exactly what to eat and what exercises to do to keep your bones strong. These authors have become popular because their information is up-to-date and based on cutting-edge research, so their advice is trustworthy and it works. And they make it simple--even if you haven't exercised since high school (and even if high school was a very long time ago!) you can follow their safe and clearly illustrated "bone-boosting workouts." Their nutritional advice won't make you load up a shopping cart with an alphabet soup of supplements like many books--instead, you'll load that shopping cart with fruits, vegetables, soy, high-calcium foods, and a calcium-vitamin D supplement. "Support your bones," advise the authors. "They support you." <i>Strong Women, Strong Bones</i> shows you how. <i>--Joan Price</i>AN INTERVIEW WITH MIRIAM NELSON: <p>I often speak to professional and community groups - it's part of my mission to spread the word about strength training and women's health. Last year I noticed that more than half of these questions concern osteoporosis. Increasingly, women know that it's so important to maintain their bones as they get older, but they're uncertain about the best strategy to follow. I decided to write this book so I could pull together all the information women - and men - need to beat this terrible disease. </p><p>My research and the research of others have taught me a great deal about osteoporosis. But I've learned just as much from the women with whom I've worked. I know that the pain of osteoporosis is not just physical. It causes emotional pain and fear - changes that sap the vitality from too many women who still have meaningful lives to lead. </p><p>I will turn 40 a month after this book is released. I'm more aware than ever that I'm at risk for this disease: I'm a woman; I'm white; I'm slender; and I have a family history of osteoporosis. And I'm also aware that I can take steps now to keep my bones strong for a lifetime. That's why no matter how busy I get, I work hard to maintain my active lifestyle and healthy diet. </p><p>Whatever your age, I urge you to heed this terrific slogan from the Massachusetts Osteoporosis Awareness Program: "Support your bones. They support you."</p></p><h2>The Devil&#39;s Dictionary</h2><p>Cynical definitions, maxims and verse illustrate the irreverent humor of this nineteenth-century satirist as he lampoons cherished American traditions</p><p><br> Ambrose Gwinnett Bierce (June 24, 1842 - circa 1914) was an American editorialist, journalist, short story writer, fabulist, and satirist. He wrote the short story "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" and compiled a satirical lexicon, <b>The Devil's Dictionary</b>. His vehemence as a critic, his motto "Nothing matters," and the sardonic view of human nature that informed his work, all earned him the nickname "Bitter Bierce." <br> Despite his reputation as a searing critic, Bierce was known to encourage younger writers, including the poets George Sterling and Herman George Scheffauer and the fiction writer W. C. Morrow. Bierce employed a distinctive style of writing, especially in his stories. His style often embraces an abrupt beginning, dark imagery, vague references to time, limited descriptions, impossible events, and the theme of war. <br> In 1913, Bierce traveled to Mexico to gain first-hand experience of the Mexican Revolution. He was rumored to be traveling with rebel troops, and was not seen again.Ambrose Gwinnett Bierce (June 24, 1842 - 1914?) was an American editorialist, journalist, short story writer, fabulist and satirist.

Over the years, between novels, he was <i>Sports Illustrated</i>'s first boxing editor and covered title fights for <i>Playboy, Esquire, Newsday</i>, and the <i>New York Post</i>. This new book collects the best of Mr. Schulberg's reportage on the Sweet Science, from Benny Leonard to Muhammad Ali to George Foreman. In addition to pieces on the great fights and great fighters of the last seventy-five years, Mr. Schulberg offers reflections on the social history of the fight game; the mystique of the heavyweight championship; the seamy side of the boxing business; and his own sparring match with Ernest Hemingway, when two aficionados of prizefighting had a verbal go at each other. Throughout, Mr. Schulberg is a pleasure to read and a passionate defender of an often maligned sport. "Boxing and civilization&#x2015;any civilization&#x2015;stand in delicate balance," he writes. "But if our civilization is indeed declining and if it finally falls, it will not be because Joe Louis clobbered Schmeling or took the measure of Billy Conn. Or because Ali made Bad Sonny Liston quit in his corner. Or because Joe Frazier landed a tremendous, humbling left hook on the controversial jaw of gallant braggadocio Muhammad Ali.&#x201d;</p><p>Budd Schulberg&#39;s love affair with boxing began when he was twelve, when his father took him to the fights at the Hollywood Legion.

Rowell, editor of the magazine Callaloo, has excellent taste in literature, but he might have given more of a context than just noting each author's country of origin/residence. Many stories center on disillusion. Tina McElroy Ansa chronicles the disintegration of a marriage, while Trinidad-born Dionne Brand's narrator, who once loved the Dallas Cowboys, learns to hate them when her country is invaded by North American forces. Many of these narrators are sharp, almost neutral observers: John Holman's protagonist listens passively as a man plans to take revenge on his sister; Edward P. Jones's narrator recalls her first day of school, "long before I learned to be ashamed of my mother." In William Melvin Kelley's wonderful story about a Harvard-educated baker who moonlights as a hit man, narrator Calvin Coolidge Johnson notes, "A few years ago, an Africamerican dressed in clean coveralls and carrying a toolkit could get into any downtown Manhattan building, day or night. Nowadays, it takes more ingenuity to penetrate places." Whatever its failings, an examination of the effects of the African diaspora on literature is an intriguing idea, and Ancestral House offers sustaining food for thought on a variety of subjects. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.YA?The diversity of backgrounds, experiences, and writing styles among contemporary African American writers is evidenced in this single-volume anthology. Seventy short stories, written by men and women who can trace their original roots to Africa, are included. Well-known authors such as Rita Dove, Ernest J. Gaines, Charles Johnson, Jamaica Kincaid, Terri McMillan, Toni Morrison, Walter Mosley, and Alice Walker appear, as well as unknown writers in translation. The stories vary in subject matter and tone; among them are voodoo, prison life, murder, rape, death, illicit relationships, sex, and a multitude of other taboo topics, as well as stories about intergenerational relationships, people who live life as it is with feelings of acceptance and self-worth.

They weren&#x2019;t: they were a hazelish shade of brown.<br><br>She stared up at him, unblinking, and felt the ground tilt beneath her feet.<br><br>It has to be him. Who else could it be?<br><br>His eyes were the wrong color, he had a tiny white scar beside his mouth that had never been there before, his hair was cut short and was kind of styled, and his six-�foot-�three-�inch frame looked leaner than it should have been. Maybe that was because the black leather motorcycle jacket he was wearing with jeans and a button-�up collared blue shirt (!) hid some of the truly impressive muscles that the T-�shirt she was used to seeing him in had revealed.<br><br>Yeah. And maybe not.<br><br>Michael? Her heart shivered at the question, which she didn&#x2019;t repeat out loud.<br><br>Dr. Elisabeth K�bler-�Ross had posited that there were five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. A little more than two weeks after Michael had disappeared&#x2014;�seventeen days, to be precise&#x2014;�Charlie reckoned that she&#x2019;d just been torpedoed right into the third stage, because what kept running through her head was a feverish Please God I&#x2019;ll do anything please.<br><br>She stood in the small, grassy graveyard, with the crude white cross that marked Michael&#x2019;s grave in front of her and the viburnum hedge from which she had once gathered an armful of flowers to mark it to her left. As the steepled old First Baptist Church loomed in the background, Charlie desperately clung to a sliver of hope.<br><br>Please let it be him.<br><br>The heavy silver man&#x2019;s watch that hung loosely around her left wrist&#x2014;�Michael&#x2019;s watch, several sizes too large for her arm&#x2014;�glinted in the golden autumn sun. She didn&#x2019;t know if that was a good sign or a bad one.<br><br>Vacillating between joy and fear, she looked at the man frowning down at her with an intensity born of marrow-�deep need. Except for those few small differences, it was all there: the square jaw, the broad cheekbones and forehead, the straight nose and beautifully cut mouth. The tawny hair, the height, the outrageous good looks. Her hand was on his arm: she could feel the solid muscles through the smooth leather of his jacket. Yet her eyes probed his and she came up empty. There was no electric zing, no trumpets signaling a joyous reunion going off in her head. The vibration she was picking up with every atom of sensitivity she possessed translated to This is a stranger. Reality hit, and the fragile little bit of hope she&#x2019;d been cherishing shattered like glass.<br><br>Face it, she told herself savagely as her hand dropped away from his arm, this gorgeous man is not Michael. He might be turning her inside out simply by standing there, but that was because of what was going on with her rather than anything to do with him.<br><br>The multicolored pinwheels of happiness, of answered prayers, of unlikely miracles that had begun twirling through her bloodstream from the moment she had set eyes on this man faded and stilled. It&#x2019;s not Michael, she told herself again, and the world once more became the gray, colorless place that his absence from her life had made it.<br><br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; she asked, her voice raspy. Her throat was so tight it hurt to talk.<br><br>&#x201c;Rick Hughes.&#x201d; The way his eyes narrowed on her face with speculation, the way the tan skin around them tightened and crinkled, made her stomach twist. The expression was all Michael, even if the brisk syllables with their total lack of a slow Southern drawl were not. &#x201c;And you are?&#x201d;<br><br>Okay, he apparently didn&#x2019;t know her. Didn&#x2019;t recognize her.<br><br>Pain curled through her system.<br><br>She introduced herself, still in that same strangled voice: &#x201c;Charlie Stone.&#x201d; Still in shock from encountering the living image of the dead man she had only lately been able to admit even to herself that she loved, standing beside the grave where his body was interred. Despite everything her senses were telling her, she continued to search the man&#x2019;s face, his eyes, for some hint of Michael, some sign that it was him after all. She forced herself to stop, to get a grip.<br><br>Michael&#x2019;s gone. She knew that, but she was obviously having trouble coming to terms with it.<br><br>Rick Hughes&#x2019;s surprised expression was so much like Michael&#x2019;s that it was the equivalent of an arrow that lodged directly in her heart.<br><br>&#x201c;Charlie Stone? Dr. Charlotte Stone?&#x201d; His gaze moved over her. Watching his face, she was able to follow along: she had chestnut brown hair, a little longer than shoulder length, that today was pulled back into a low ponytail. Delicate features, fair complexion, denim blue eyes. Five-�six and slender. Actually, more slender than usual, because since Michael had disappeared she&#x2019;d barely been eating. Once Michael had told her men expected someone with her credentials to be butt-�ugly instead of the babe he&#x2019;d labeled her. Remembering this, she interpreted Hughes&#x2019;s expression accurately, or at least she was pretty sure it was accurately. Her spine stiffened in response to the sheer sexism of men who automatically assumed that an educated woman would be unattractive.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she replied. And yes, okay, there was possibly a frosty overtone to her answer.<br><br>&#x201c;I was just up at Wallens Ridge,&#x201d; he said, referring to the supermax prison where Charlie, a psychiatrist, was currently conducting research on a government grant, studying the psychology of serial killers. It was also the place where, a little more than eight weeks ago now, Michael had been murdered. &#x201c;And I was told that you&#x2019;re the person I need to see. I was also told that you wouldn&#x2019;t be available for several more days, as you&#x2019;d taken a temporary leave of absence.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I did.&#x201d; To assist an FBI team in catching a serial killer. Less than an hour before on this late Thursday afternoon in early October, she&#x2019;d arrived back at Lonesome Pine Airport with plans to take the weekend to get her head on straight before returning to work at the prison on Monday. She&#x2019;d been five minutes away from her house in Big Stone Gap when, from the backseat of the taxi that was currently waiting by the curb, she had spotted his stunningly familiar figure in the graveyard. Only, of course, in the way things tended to work in her life, it turned out that he was the wrong man.<br><br>The tiny part of her brain that wasn&#x2019;t still reeling from shock scoffed: You didn&#x2019;t really think that he was Michael standing there, alive, did you?<br><br>But from the crushing sense of loss she was experiencing, it seemed that somewhere deep in her heart, or soul, she had.<br><br>You can&#x2019;t be gone. Not just like that. She sent the thought winging directly toward Michael, one of dozens that had taken that route since he&#x2019;d disappeared, and immediately shut that folly down. Even if, somewhere in the misty reaches of the universe, he by some miracle did still exist (and she knew she shouldn&#x2019;t even begin to allow herself to hope for that), mental telepathy had never been part of their thing. And yes, sometimes bad things happened, just like that.<br><br>Bad things like Michael being destroyed.<br><br>Taking a deep breath, Charlie tried to focus. When it came to her professional life she tried to keep things, well, professional. Her hands were clenched into tight fists at her sides, she discovered. She wasn&#x2019;t yet able to tear her eyes away from this man&#x2019;s handsome face, but she made herself unclench her fingers.<br><br>&#x201c;What can I do for you?&#x201d; she asked, liking to think that her voice sounded less off-�putting than it had before.<br><br>&#x201c;I have a court order granting me access to some files that are apparently in your possession.&#x201d; He cocked a thumb at the grave, which, because it was still fairly new, formed a little higher mound and sported a little less grass than the ones around it. M. A. Garland had been hand-�painted on the marker in black, slightly uneven letters, along with the dates of Michael&#x2019;s birth and death. Looking at it made her chest ache. &#x201c;On this guy: Michael Garland.&#x201d;<br><br>Once again the ground seemed to tilt beneath Charlie&#x2019;s feet. Hearing Michael&#x2019;s name spoken out loud was bad enough, but at his graveside by his doppelg�nger?<br><br>Really, God? What fresh hell is this?<br><br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; she asked again, in a different intonation. If he wasn&#x2019;t Michael&#x2014;�and he wasn&#x2019;t, she was now almost convinced of that&#x2014;�then the fact that this man existed, that he was apparently alive and real and human and right at this moment standing close enough to touch, officially blew her mind.<br><br>Her subconscious was shouting a warning: Hello, something&#x2019;s up. Big red flag here.<br><br>All kinds of crazy possibilities started popping into her mind, running the gamut from his being some kind of shape-�shifting demon to a faux-�Michael from an alternate dimension to a very real-�seeming hallucination brought on by grief and stress. At least, these possibilities might seem crazy to anyone who didn&#x2019;t live in her world. Short version was, she had the unfortunate ability to see the newly, violently dead; Michael had been one of the serial killers she was studying; had gotten himself murdered; and then, as one of those newly violently dead that only she could see, had come back as a ghost to haunt, taunt, and otherwise make her life miserable until she&#x2019;d made the truly colossal mistake of falling in love with him, at which point he&#x2019;d been yanked away into a purple-�twilight version of purgatory, where, according to all the psychic sources she&#x2019;d desperately consulted when he had disappeared, he&#x2019;d almost certainly suffered a fate far worse than death or even hell: oblivion.<br><br>In other words, the possibility of a shape-�shifting demon or alternate dimension or too-�real hallucination wasn&#x2019;t as outlandish as it might sound.<br><br>To put it succinctly, in her world shit happened.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a lawyer,&#x201d; Hughes said, adding to her complete and utter shock. That this spitting image of Michael, whose contempt for every component of the justice system was oceans deep, was a lawyer floored her. &#x201c;A criminal defense lawyer,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The client I&#x2019;m here on behalf of was charged with murdering his girlfriend. In the course of investigating the circumstances surrounding the crime, we discovered that it was identical in every significant detail to those committed by a serial killer known as the Southern Slasher&#x201d;&#x2014;�he jerked a thumb at the grave again&#x2014;�&#x201c;also known as Michael Garland. I thought we had a winner of an alternative theory about the identity of the true killer in my client&#x2019;s case until I learned that Mr. Garland was in prison at the time this particular murder was committed. Still, I&#x2019;m hoping that by following up on Mr. Garland I might learn something that&#x2019;ll shed some light on my client&#x2019;s case.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Since you&#x2019;re here, you obviously know he&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d; She couldn&#x2019;t say Michael&#x2019;s name aloud: it just wouldn&#x2019;t come out. For her to not see Michael&#x2019;s grave was also impossible. It was there, in her field of vision, no matter how much she fought to not look at it. But looking at the man in front of her was even worse: it hurt. In the past two-�plus weeks, she&#x2019;d discovered that psychic pain could be every bit as agonizing as pain inflicted by a gun or a knife. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not going to be shedding light on anything. You could have just sent for the files.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d also like to talk to you,&#x201d; Hughes said. From his voice, she was pretty sure he&#x2019;d grown up somewhere north of the Mason-�Dixon Line. The vibe he gave off was more big-�city polished than anything Mi&#x2014;�no, she wasn&#x2019;t going there. You have to stop thinking about him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hoping you can help me with some questions I have.&#x201d;<br><br>The last thing in the world she wanted to do was talk to him about anything, much less about Michael. Encountering him like this had shaken her badly; she had barely been keeping it together as it was. Now this&#x2014;�this terrible cosmic joke the universe was apparently playing on her was making her head spin, making it hard for her to catch her breath, making it impossible for her to think clearly. Looking at the man in front of her was physically painful. And it was starting to feel scary. If he wasn&#x2019;t Michael&#x2014;<br><br>He&#x2019;s not. You know he&#x2019;s not.<br><br>At the moment she wasn&#x2019;t capable of much critical thinking beyond that, but she had managed to form and hold on to one crucial thought: Until you get this figured out, you need to be careful.<br><br>There was so much wrong with what was happening here she couldn&#x2019;t even begin to count the ways.</p><h2>The Tree Where Man Was Born / The African Experience</h2><p>In this classic volume, Matthiessen exquisitely combines both nature and travel writing to bring East Africa to vivid life. He skillfully portrays the daily lives of herdsmen and hunter-gatherers; the drama of the predator kills; the hundreds of exotic animals; the breathtaking landscapes; and the area&#39;s turbulent natural, political, and social histories.</p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettesPETER MATTHIESSEN has written eight novels, a book of short stories, and, from his career as a naturalist and environmental activist, numerous acclaimed works of nonfiction. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1974. He has won two National Book Awards, including the 2008 award for fiction for his book <i>Shadow Country</i>.</p><h2>The girl who loved wild horses</h2><p>Though she is fond of her people, a girl prefers to live among the wild horses where she is truly happy and free.</p><p>For most people, being swept away in a horse stampede during a raging thunderstorm would be a terrifying disaster. For the young Native American girl in Paul Goble's 1979 Caldecott-winning masterpiece, <i>The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses</i>, it is a blessing. Although she loves her people, this girl has a much deeper, almost sacred connection to her equine friends. The storm gives her the opportunity to fulfill her dream--to live in a beautiful land among the wild horses she loves.<p> With brilliant, stylized illustrations and simple text, Paul Goble tells the story of a young woman who follows her heart, and the family that respects and accepts her uniqueness. Considering how difficult it is for some communities to allow friendships to grow between people of different cultures, this village's support for the girl's companions of choice is admirable. Goble's bold paintings reflect this noble open-mindedness. The young horse fanatic of the house will joyfully add this book to his or her collection. Children are passionate people; they will relate. (All ages) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>In Paul Goble's Caldecott-winning story, tending to the horses is the special pleasure of one young girl in the village. Her skills are unsurpassed, and people take notice. When a violent thunderstorm crazes the herd, both it and the girl travel to new destinations. As narrator, Lance White Magpie sets an expectant tone, as it appears that the horses will change the girl's life. Finally, his voice becomes one of confidence and satisfaction when the young girl finds her place beside the spotted stallion. Gentle music surrounds the story. Chants and songs from Sioux and Navaho traditions complete the recording.

In <i>Chinese Painting Style</i> Jerome Silbergeld addresses this need, beginning with a discussion of basic materials and methods and continuing with in-depth studies of the complex paintings created by these methods. No other work so thoroughly or systematically describes the Chinese artistic processes, ranging from the distinctively Chinese manner of handling the brush to the blending of brushlines, wash, color, and texture into a painted composition. The final chapters examine Chinese composition in terms of naturalistic representation and of abstract expression.<br><br>Throughout the book, artistic problems are set against a background of Chinese history, ideas, and geography. The illustrations include drawings that reveal the principles of Chinese brushwork, together with a broad range of Chinese paintings and calligraphy. A unique feature is the precise coding of text and illustrations, by which the reader is invited to inspect the specific turn of the brush or adjustment of composition by which the artist achieves his effects.<br><br><i>Chinese Painting Style</i> provides a penetrating look into the formal basis of this age-old art, and one that will be useful and engaging both to the general reader and to the serious student.</p><p></p><h2>Pistis Sophia A Coptic Gnostic Text with Commentary</h2><p>The Coptic Gnostic narrative theme which attempts to explain the dilemma of humanity&#39;s predicament as a realm of intelligence amidst many realms of Life, both visible and invisible. It also emphasizes the role of female disciples in the ministry of Jesus the Christ. The later chapters contain much information concerning the soul and its origin: exploring how the soul comes to birth through the Virgin of Light and departs from earth-life. The text also explains how the soul works within the Light-power and the spiritual elements in humanity, all being connected with the strivings of Wisdom/Sophia.</p><p></p><h2>The Hard Way</h2><p>Jack Reacher was alone, the way he liked it, soaking up the hot, electric New York City night, watching a man cross the street to a parked Mercedes and drive it away. The car contained one million dollars in ransom money. And Edward Lane, the man who paid it, will pay even more to get his family back. Lane runs a highly illegal soldiers-for-hire operation. He will use any amount of money and any tool to find his beautiful wife and child. And then he&#x2019;ll turn Jack Reacher loose with a vengeance - because Reacher is the best man hunter in the world. On the trail of a vicious kidnapper, Reacher is learning the chilling secrets of his employer&#x2019;s past...and of a horrific drama in the heart of a nasty little war. He&#x2019;s beginning to realize that Edward Lane is hiding something. Something dirty. Something big. But Reacher also knows this: he&#x2019;s already in way too deep to stop now.</p><p>LEE CHILD is the author of ten Jack Reacher thrillers, including the New York Times bestsellers Persuader, the Barry Award Winner The Enemy, and One Shot, which has been optioned for a major motion picture by Paramount Pictures. His debut, Killing Floor, won both the Anthony and the Barry Awards for Best First Mystery. Foreign rights in the Jack Reacher series have sold in thirty-nine territories. Child, a native of England and former television writer, lives in New York City, where he is at work on his eleventh Jack Reacher thriller.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>JACK REACHER ORDERED espresso, double, no peel, no cube, foam cup, no china, and before it arrived at his table he saw a man's life change forever. Not that the waiter was slow. Just that the move was slick. So slick, Reacher had no idea what he was watching. It was just an urban scene, repeated everywhere in the world a billion times a day: A guy unlocked a car and got in and drove away. That was all.<br><br>But that was enough.<br><br>The espresso had been close to perfect, so Reacher went back to the same cafe&#x17d; exactly -twenty--four hours later. Two nights in the same place was unusual for Reacher, but he figured great coffee was worth a change in his routine. The caf� was on the west side of Sixth Avenue in New York City, in the middle of the block between Bleecker and Houston. It occupied the ground floor of an undistinguished -four--story building. The upper stories looked like anonymous rental apartments. The cafe itself looked like a transplant from a back street in Rome. Inside it had low light and scarred wooden walls and a dented chrome machine as hot and long as a locomotive, and a counter. Outside there was a single line of metal tables on the sidewalk behind a low canvas screen. Reacher took the same end table he had used the night before and chose the same seat. He stretched out and got comfortable and tipped his chair up on two legs. That put his back against the cafe's outside wall and left him looking east, across the sidewalk and the width of the avenue. He liked to sit outside in the summer, in New York City. Especially at night. He liked the electric darkness and the hot dirty air and the blasts of noise and traffic and the manic barking sirens and the crush of people. It helped a lonely man feel connected and isolated both at the same time.<br><br>He was served by the same waiter as the night before and ordered the same drink, double espresso in a foam cup, no sugar, no spoon. He paid for it as soon as it arrived and left his change on the table. That way he could leave exactly when he wanted to without insulting the waiter or bilking the owner or stealing the china. Reacher always arranged the smallest details in his life so he could move on at a split second's notice. It was an obsessive habit. He owned nothing and carried nothing. Physically he was a big man, but he cast a small shadow and left very little in his wake.<br><br>He drank his coffee slowly and felt the night heat come up off the sidewalk. He watched cars and people. Watched taxis flow north and garbage trucks pause at the curbs. Saw knots of strange young people heading for clubs. Watched girls who had once been boys totter south. Saw a blue German sedan park on the block. Watched a compact man in a gray suit get out and walk north. Watched him thread between two sidewalk tables and head inside to where the cafe staff was clustered in back. Watched him ask them questions.<br><br>The guy was medium height, not young, not old, too solid to be called wiry, too slight to be called heavy. His hair was gray at the temples and cut short and neat. He kept himself balanced on the balls of his feet. His mouth didn't move much as he talked. But his eyes did. They flicked left and right tirelessly. The guy was about forty, Reacher guessed, and furthermore Reacher guessed he had gotten to be about forty by staying relentlessly aware of everything that was happening around him. Reacher had seen the same look in elite infantry veterans who had survived long jungle tours.<br><br>Then Reacher's waiter turned suddenly and pointed straight at him. The compact man in the gray suit stared over. Reacher stared back, over his shoulder, through the window. Eye contact was made. Without breaking it the man in the suit mouthed <i>thank you</i> to the waiter and started back out the way he had entered. He stepped through the door and made a right inside the low canvas screen and threaded his way down to Reacher's table. Reacher let him stand there mute for a moment while he made up his mind. Then he said "Yes," to him, like an answer, not a question.<br><br>"Yes what?" the guy said back.<br><br>"Yes whatever," Reacher said. "Yes I'm having a pleasant evening, yes you can join me, yes you can ask me whatever it is you want to ask me."<br><br>The guy scraped a chair out and sat down, his back to the river of traffic, blocking Reacher's view.<br><br>"Actually I do have a question," he said.<br><br>"I know," Reacher said. "About last night."<br><br>"How did you know that?" The guy's voice was low and quiet and his accent was flat and clipped and British.<br><br>"The waiter pointed me out," Reacher said. "And the only thing that distinguishes me from his other customers is that I was here last night and they weren't."<br><br>"You're certain about that?"<br><br>"Turn your head away," Reacher said. "Watch the traffic."<br><br>The guy turned his head away. Watched the traffic.<br><br>"Now tell me what I'm wearing," Reacher said.<br><br>"Green shirt," the British guy said. "Cotton, baggy, cheap, doesn't look new, sleeves rolled to the elbow, over a green T-shirt, also cheap and not new, a little tight, untucked over -flat--front khaki chinos, no socks, English shoes, pebbled leather, brown, not new, but not very old either, probably expensive. Frayed laces, like you pull on them too hard when you tie them. Maybe indicative of a -self--discipline obsession."<br><br>"OK," Reacher said.<br><br>"OK what?"<br><br>"You notice things," Reacher said. "And I notice things. We're two of a kind. We're peas in a pod. I'm the only customer here now who was also here last night. I'm certain of that. And that's what you asked the staff. Had to be. That's the only reason the waiter would have pointed me out."<br><br>The guy turned back.<br><br>"Did you see a car last night?" he asked.<br><br>"I saw plenty of cars last night," Reacher said. "This is Sixth Avenue."<br><br>"A Mercedes Benz. Parked over there." The guy twisted again and pointed on a slight diagonal at a length of empty curb by a fire hydrant on the other side of the street.<br><br>Reacher said, "Silver, four-door sedan, an S-420, New York vanity plates starting OSC, a lot of city miles on it. Dirty paint, scuffed tires, dinged rims, dents and scrapes on both bumpers."<br><br>The guy turned back again.<br><br>"You saw it," he said.<br><br>"It was right there," Reacher said. "Obviously I saw it."<br><br>"Did you see it leave?"<br><br>Reacher nodded. "Just before eleven -forty--five a guy got in and drove it away."<br><br>"You're not wearing a watch."<br><br>"I always know what time it is."<br><br>"It must have been closer to midnight."<br><br>"Maybe," Reacher said. "Whatever."<br><br>"Did you get a look at the driver?"<br><br>"I told you, I saw him get in and drive away."<br><br>The guy stood up.<br><br>"I need you to come with me," he said. Then he put his hand in his pocket. "I'll buy your coffee."<br><br>"I already paid for it."<br><br>"So let's go."<br><br>"Where?"<br><br>"To see my boss."<br><br>"Who's your boss?"<br><br>"A man called Lane."<br><br>"You're not a cop," Reacher said. "That's my guess. Based on observation."<br><br>"Of what?"<br><br>"Your accent. You're not American. You're British. The NYPD isn't that desperate."<br><br>"Most of us are Americans," the British guy said. "But you're right, we're not cops. We're private citizens."<br><br>"What kind?"<br><br>"The kind that will make it worth your while if you give them a description of the individual who drove that car away."<br><br>"Worth my while how?"<br><br>"Financially," the guy said. "Is there any other way?"<br><br>"Lots of other ways," Reacher said. "I think I'll stay right here."<br><br>"This is very serious."<br><br>"How?"<br><br>The guy in the suit sat down again.<br><br>"I can't tell you that," he said.<br><br>"Goodbye," Reacher said.<br><br>"Not my choice," the guy said. "Mr. Lane made it -mission--critical that nobody knows. For very good reasons."<br><br>Reacher tilted his cup and checked the contents. Nearly gone.<br><br>"You got a name?" he asked.<br><br>"Do you?"<br><br>"You first."<br><br>In response the guy stuck a thumb into the breast pocket of his suit coat and slid out a black leather business card holder. He opened it up and used the same thumb to slide out a single card. He passed it across the table. It was a handsome item. Heavy linen stock, raised lettering, ink that still looked wet. At the top it said: <i>Operational Security Consultants</i>.<br><br>"OSC," Reacher said. "Like the license plate."<br><br>The British guy said nothing.<br><br>Reacher smiled. "You're security consultants and you got your car stolen? I can see how that could be embarrassing."<br><br>The guy said, "It's not the car we're worried about."<br>Lower down on the business card was a name: <i>John Gregory</i>. Under the name was a subscript: <i>British Army, Retired</i>. Then a job title: <i>Executive Vice President</i>.<br><br>"How long have you been out?" Reacher asked.<br><br>"Of the British Army?" the guy called Gregory said. "Seven years."<br><br>"Unit?"<br><br>"SAS."<br><br>"You've still got the look."<br><br>"You too," Gregory said. "How long have you been out?"<br><br>"Seven years," Reacher said.<br><br>"Unit?"<br><br>"U.S. Army CID, mostly."<br><br>Gregory looked up. Interested. "Investigator?"<br><br>"Mostly."<br><br>"Rank?"<br><br>"I don't remember," Reacher said. "I've been a civilian seven years."<br><br>"Don't be shy," Gregory said. "You were probably a lieutenant colonel at least."<br><br>"Major," Reacher said. "That's as far as I got."<br><br>"Career problems?"<br><br>"I had my share."<br><br>"You got a name?"<br><br>"Most people do."<br><br>"What is it?"<br><br>"Reacher."<br><br>"What are you doing now?"<br><br>"I'm trying to get a quiet cup of coffee."<br><br>"You need work?"<br><br>"No," Reacher said. "I don't."<br><br>"I was a sergeant," Gregory said.<br><br>Reacher nodded. "I figured. SAS guys usually are. And you've got the look."<br><br>"So will you come with me and talk to Mr. Lane?"<br><br>"I told you what I saw. You can pass it on."<br><br>"Mr. Lane will want to hear it direct."<br><br>Reacher checked his cup again. "Where is he?"<br><br>"Not far. Ten minutes."<br><br>"I don't know," Reacher said. "I'm enjoying my espresso."<br><br>"Bring it with you. It's in a foam cup."<br><br>"I prefer peace and quiet."<br><br>"All I want is ten minutes."<br><br>"Seems like a lot of fuss over a stolen car, even if it was a Mercedes Benz."<br><br>"This is not about the car."<br><br>"So what is it about?"<br><br>"Life and death," Gregory said. "Right now more likely death than life."<br><br>Reacher checked his cup again. There was less than a lukewarm -eighth--inch left, thick and scummy with espresso mud. That was all. He put the cup down.<br><br>"OK," he said. "So let's go."</p><h2>The Myth of the Spoiled Child: Challenging the Conventional Wisdom about Children and Parenting</h2><p>Somehow, a set of deeply conservative assumptions about children--what they're like and how they should be raised--have congealed into the conventional wisdom in our society. Parents are accused of being both permissive and overprotective, unwilling to set limits and afraid to let their kids fail. Young people, meanwhile, are routinely described as entitled and narcissistic...among other unflattering adjectives.<br><br>In <i>The Myth of the Spoiled Child</i>, Alfie Kohn systematically debunks these beliefs--not only challenging erroneous factual claims but also exposing the troubling ideology that underlies them. Complaints about pushover parents and coddled kids are hardly new, he shows, and there is no evidence that either phenomenon is especially widespread today--let alone more common than in previous generations. Moreover, new research reveals that helicopter parenting is quite rare and, surprisingly, may do more good than harm when it does occur. The major threat to healthy child development, John argues, is posed by parenting that is too controlling rather than too indulgent.<br><br>With the same lively, contrarian style that marked his influential books about rewards, competition, and education, Kohn relies on a vast collection of social science data, as well as on logic and humor, to challenge assertions that appear with numbing regularity in the popular press. These include claims that young people suffer from inflated self-esteem; that they receive trophies, praise, and As too easily; and that they would benefit from more self-discipline and "grit." These conservative beliefs are often accepted without question, even by people who are politically liberal. Kohn's invitation to reexamine our assumptions is particularly timely, then; his book has the potential to change our culture's conversation about kids and the people who raise them.<br></p><p><b>Alfie Kohn</b> is the author of twelve previous books--including <i>The Homework Myth</i>, <i>Unconditional Parenting</i>, and <i>Punished by Rewards</i>--and hundreds of articles.

Kohn patiently dismantles myths about 'helicopter parenting,' every kid getting a trophy in every endeavor, and parents allegedly inflating their kids' self-esteem, and shows the myths to be not just without merit but destructive. Then he goes beyond the critique to provide a positive vision of parenting for our time, 'working with' kids rather than 'doing to' them.

Although the world offers advice through professional counselors, well-meaning (but not always wise) friends, or even psychics and astrologers, as a Christian you know you can turn to God for real answers. But before turning to Him, are you willing to put your faith and trust in Him explicitly, even if His timing and what He shows you may not be according to your desires or expectations? <br><br> God's Guidance will not show you how to find God's will in six easy steps. Instead, Elisabeth Elliot invites you to draw closer to God so you can walk in His light, confidently, one step at a time. Here is a practical book to confirm and inspire your continued faith when coming to God for the "big" and "little" answers to life.<br> Elisabeth Elliot has pointed the way to a closer walk with God through several books, including A Chance to Die, Passion and Purity, The Mark of a Man, Discipline: The Glad Surrender, and On Asking God Why.</p><p></p><h2>Persuasion</h2><p>Jane Austen&#39;s last novel was posthumously published in 1818. This new edition is edited from the existing fragments of the manuscript.</p><p>Anne Elliot, heroine of Austen&#39;s last novel, did something we can all relate to: Long ago, she let the love of her life get away. In this case, she had allowed herself to be persuaded by a trusted family friend that the young man she loved wasn&#39;t an adequate match, social stationwise, and that Anne could do better. The novel opens some seven years after Anne sent her beau packing, and she&#39;s still alone. But then the guy she never stopped loving comes back from the sea. As always, Austen&#39;s storytelling is so confident, you can&#39;t help but allow yourself to be taken on the enjoyable journey.This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

A realized master of the Tantric Nath lineage, he lived and taught in the slums of Bombay, India. <p>A steady stream of students, Indians and Westerners, fortunate enough to discover Maharaj during his lifetime, came to sit at his feet in the small loft where he received visitors. In the tradition of Ramana Maharshi, he shared the highest Truth of nonduality in his own unique way, from the depths of his own realization. The profound yet simple words of this extraordinary teacher jolt us into awareness. Like the Zen masters of old, Nisargadatta's style is abrupt, provocative, and immensely profound. His terse, potent sayings trigger shifts in consciousness, just by hearing, or even reading them. </p><p>Compiled during the last year of Nisargadatta 's life, The Ultimate Medicine provides advanced instruction for spiritual aspirants. Not for those who like their spirituality watered down, but for serious students seeking powerful antidotes to unawareness. Edited by Robert Powell, renowned spiritual author.</p></p><p>Dr. Powell is recognized as one of the most inspired and knowledgeable writers on the subject of Advaita, the teaching of non-duality. He guides us beyond the realm of ego, beyond the illusion of subject and object, self and other. This is where the mind and cognition cannot take us, and Dr. Powell does a masterful job of lighting the path to where we have never been."In the Ultimate Medicine, Nisargadatta, like the great sages of old India, elucidated the nature of Ultimate Reality clearly and simply. He makes the highest Self-realization a matter of common understanding so that any sincere seeker can grasp the essence of it." -- <i>David Frawley, OMD, author of Beyond the Mind,Tantric Yoga,and Ayurvedic Healing</i><br><br>"Nisargadatta Maharaj is my greatest teacher. His words guide my writing, speaking and all of my relationships." -- <i>Dr. Wayne Dyer, author of Your Sacred Self and Your Erroneous Zones</i></p><h2>Essays in Understanding: 1930-1954</h2><p>Essays discuss Augustine, Rilke, Kierkegaard, immigrant groups in the United States, the unification of Europe, religion, politics, isolation, careerism, and totalitarian rule</p><p>Hannah Arendt taught political science and philosophy at the New School for Social Research in New York and at the University of Chicago.Compiled, edited, and briefly annotated by Hannah Arendt's longtime assistant Jerome Kohn (Political and Social Science/New School), this first of two projected volumes collecting Arendt's (1906-75) essays, addresses, and reviews up to 1954 contains two previously unpublished essays: ``On the Nature of Totalitarianism'' (1953) and ``The Concern with Politics in Contemporary European Philosophical Thought'' (1954). The personal, affectionate, and slightly apologetic introduction places these mostly fugitive pieces in context, but it is still difficult to see evidence here of the seminal role Arendt was to play in modern political theory, especially in analyzing the nature and dangers of totalitarianism and the mercurial nature of justice, which she explored in her popular, controversial, and, she believed, misunderstood Eichmann in Jerusalem. Kohn's collection opens with Arendt's defense of that study and some personal reminiscences expressed in a 1964 interview with G nter Gaus. The volume also offers commemorative addresses on St. Augustine, Kierkegaard, Kafka, and Karl Jaspers as well as re-evaluations of the forgotten, such as Friedrich von Gentz (1764-1832), and of the fleeting, the Berlin Salon from 1789-1806. There are book reviews ranging from the anachronistic 1933 German monograph On the Emancipation of Women and Karl Mannheim's heady Ideology and Utopia to Denis De Rougement's unlikely history of Satan, The Devil's Share. Included too are essays on the foreign-language press in America, on postwar Germany, fascism, communism, the atom bomb, McCarthyism, more characteristic ethical reflections on guilt and responsibility, and concise histories of French and German existentialism. Largely ``residual reflections,'' according to Kohn, these pieces appear to be quaint, irrelevant, and narrowly focused exercises, only faintly foreshadowing the ``bleak pessimism'' of the ``terrible century'' Arendt was later to dissect. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Demoted from sergeant to trooper, exiled to Newenham, a town teeming with fiercely independent Natives, he lives on a leaky gillnetter moored in Bristol Bay, brooding on how to put down roots on dry land again and rekindle his relationship with bush pilot Wyanet Chouinard, who won his heart long ago, and then broke it.<br>Then word arrives from Kulukak: The fishing boat Marybethia is adrift, victim of a shipboard fire. Flying out with Trooper Diana Prince, his new assistant and pilot, Liam arrives to find the horribly burned bodies of a family of local fishers and their crew. Was it a terrible accident? Or a cover-up of something worse?<br>At the same time, on a routine air-taxi run to a dig near Chinook Air Force Base, Wy discovers a young archaeological assistant, gruesomely murdered. And to make a perfect day complete, Liam's estranged father, Air Force Colonel Charles Campbell, flies into Newenham on assignment to the Chinook base. Even for Newenham, things are getting out of hand.<br>From Bill's Bar and Grill, where the local magistrate metes out her own brand of justice - Bristol Bay-style - to a remote northern shore where herds of walrus emerge from a sullen sea, Liam follows a trail of false leads, false confessions, and false hopes.</p><p>Dana Stabenow lives in Anchorage, Alaska, where she also cohosts a radio show about books on KBYR. She is the author of the Kate Shugak series (Putnam/Berkley) and <i>Fire and Ice</i> (Dutton/Signet). She also has a Web site at www.stabenow.com.Stabenow's second Liam Campbell mystery (after Fire and Ice) has the vivid descriptions, rich characterization and compelling plot that distinguish her nine Kate Shugak books, with the added advantage of extra sex appeal. Alaska State Trooper Campbell, stationed in the southwest Alaska boondocks, has a lot on his plate: an eager new trooper, Diana Prince; a visit from his estranged father, an air force colonel on a suspicious mission; the reappearance of his great love, charter pilot Wyanet (Wy) Chouinard; and two very different cases rife with false clues. When an assistant at an important archeological site is murdered, evidence points to Frank Petla, a Yupik grave robber who travels by four-wheeler. Liam apprehends him in a dramatic chase by leaping out of Wy's Cub into a lake, but later comes to believe Frank's profession of innocence. The desperate murderer finally reveals himself, almost killing Wy and her journalist friend Jo. Finding a killer who sets fire to a fishing boat, incinerating all seven people aboard, proves a more difficult task. Initially, Liam suspects a disgruntled former deckhand, but the solution hinges on careful observation and an understanding of Yupik lifestyles and traditions, a necessity for these white cops in a predominantly Native American population. Colorful characters abound, and Stabenow ably evokes the life of hard-pressed commercial fishermen. The mystery ends on a mystical note, integrating Native American belief into a satisfying conclusion.

Even though all those are possible, they are all tough. Visitors who try to drive get into a tangle of unmarked mountain roads, roads with zits and potholes and lots of landslides. Most drivers who make it through (I talked about it with two of them in New York and another one in London) get turned back at the border. There is something wrong with their passports, or their cars, or their luggage. They have not got visas, which everybody told them they would not need. Some are arrested and their cars impounded. A few of the ones who are arrested never get out. Or anyhow, that is how it seems.</p> <p><br>It just made me more determined than ever. There are no travel books about the land across the mountains. NONE! Not in any language I could find. I was going to be the first, and maybe I still will be. Only this book you are holding comes before my travel book. You would not believe how long I have been writing and rewriting this one in my head, especially when I was a prisoner of the Legion of the Light and when I was in prison, sitting around in a cell with Russ Rathaus. I was lucky, I cannot even tell you how lucky, that I was never taken prisoner by the Unholy Way. Thank God for that!</p> <p><br>At first I tried to get in by air. Lufthansa has service, but there are only two flights a week. I booked twice and had both canceled. The third did not land at the capital, saying bad weather. It went straight on to Ankara.</p> <p><br>I decided to go by train and flew to Vienna, a real knockout city where there are lots of first-rate clubs. (See my first book, <i>Dreaming on the Danube</i>.) After some swell evenings dancing in the clubs and okay nights at the good old Hotel Sacher, I caught the Orient Express headed for Slovakia. For the rest of the day our train wound its way through hills and woods.</p> <p><br>A lot of Americans think all of Europe is like Rouen or Cologne, crawling with people. It is not really like that. There is a whole lot more wilderness in Europe than foreigners like us imagine, and there is more and more as you go east. I hardly ever saw a house among the hills I saw from the Orient Express. Where there were a few, they were half-timbered and had those high sharp roofs you get where there is lots of snow.</p> <p><br>A porter who would not talk to me made the bed in my compartment. When he had gone, I stripped and washed the way I generally do on trains, with a washcloth I dunked in a hand basin of water. Now it seems to me that I must have been asleep a long time before I got into bed.</p> <p><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p><br>I woke up during the night, and I will never forget it. We had stopped where they had fields of some kind of grain that grew a lot taller than a man. Silent men walked up and down the train, men I could just barely make out by starlight. They looked small, but I think they were really big men. They carried what I figured were dark lanterns, boxy black gadgets that shed floods of light you did not expect when they were opened. I had read about those but I had never seen any before. The train jolted and jolted again. I think it was probably the first of those jolts that woke me up.</p> <p><br>One of the men stopped at my window to look up at me. I stared out at him through the dirty glass. He held up his lantern, which scared hell out of me. I do not know why. Anyway, I ducked down and backed away as far as I could without leaving my little compartment.</p> <p><br>I was naked, and I decided right then that when I got back home I was going to buy pajamas as soon as I could. If I only had pajamas or a robe, both would have been better; I could have gone into the corridor outside where I might have found the porter and gotten him to talk to me. Traveling the way he did from Calais to Cairo and from Cairo back to Calais, he would have a lot of interesting stuff to tell if I could get him to tell it.</p> <p><br>As it was, I stayed flat against the steel door of my compartment until the train got moving again, rattling and swaying along tracks that went up and down while they were turning left and right.<br>Everybody interested enough to read this book knows about the High Tatras and the Transylvanian Alps. Let me just say that the mountains I saw next morning were not particularly high, but rugged and dotted here and there with fir trees the wind had tortured. It was early spring, and the water spilling down their cliffs made me think of a certain type of girl, the tall cold blondes that knock your eyes out. Later I met Rosalee Rathaus, and she was a blond knockout even if she hardly came up to my chin in heels. I bet she would not weigh eighty pounds soaking wet. She was a good dancer, too. She promised me but I never collected. We will get into that in one of the later chapters.</p> <p><br>After breakfast in the dining car, I went back to my compartment. I read until I got bored, then I had a look at the observation car. It was the double-decked kind, which I have always liked. I climbed the little stair to the upper deck and sat in one of the very cool swiveling red-leather seats there and watched the scenery whiz past until I fell asleep.</p> <p><br>When I woke up, the train was going faster than ever, rattling and swaying as it crossed a big wasteland scarred with gullies.</p> <p><br>Three border guards in uniforms were standing around me, and the biggest of the three was shaking my shoulder. Then the boss border guard, a skinny guy a lot shorter than me, started yelling questions in a language I did not know. The car was empty except for the four of us.<br>I got my passport out of my jacket and showed it to him. He passed it to the third border guard without looking at it. After that, they made me stand up, patted me down, took my iPhone, and tied my hands behind me. I guess I was scared, but mostly I was stunned.</p> <p><br>The boss border guard marched along the upper deck of the observation car, motioning for me to follow. I did, noticing that the railing (which I knew darn well had been there when I had climbed to the upper deck) had been taken down. Steep little steps led from the upper deck to the main floor. The boss border guard trotted down them and I did my best to follow him. I was about halfway down when somebody pushed me. I fell, bumping into the boss border guard. I believe he must have landed on the lower steps. I rolled over him all the way to the bottom. He got up cursing and kicking. I could not understand his curses, but I knew what they were all right. I had never been kicked before and had not really known how bad it is. I think I must have blacked out.</p> <p><br>The next thing I remember is being taken off the train, trying to walk and stumbling a lot while someone with strong hands held my arm.</p> <p><br>The train had not slowed down but was roaring along beside a narrow black conveyer belt that was going even faster than it was, so that the shiny steel bands the sections were joined with looked like they were crawling slowly past us. We were waiting for the other two, or that was what it seemed like. When they joined us, the big guy who held me stepped from the train onto the belt, dragging me with him. Like I said, the belt went faster than the train had. It ran smoother, too. Beside it grass, brush, and dust pointed the way, blown by a howling wind. For us on the belt, it seemed like there was no wind at all. I noticed then that the train&#x2019;s diesel engine was gone, and there was a big steam engine up front. It was twice as big but looked old. It seemed to be trying to outrun its own smoke, but it could not do it.</p> <p><br>If I had thought at all, I would have thought that we would be thrown off the end of the belt and die. It was not like that. Another, wider belt appeared to our right. This new belt was white, and moving slower than the black one. I fell when I tried to step onto it.</p> <p><br>The boss border guard helped me up. His dark gray uniform cap had been mashed, and his scarlet-trimmed tunic was more than half-unbuttoned. (I think it was because three or four of the buttons had torn off.) Still he murmured, <i>&#x201c;Auanactain! Profasis!&#x201d;</i> like he was sorry I had been hurt. A minute later he helped me onto a red belt. I never did figure him out, only back then I thought maybe I could. My dad used to say foreigners&#x2019; values were not the same as ours. Then he would dope them out anyway.</p> <p><br>The red belt slowed down, I could feel the wind, and the biggest of the three helped me get off, lifting me like he would have picked up a little kid.</p> <p><br>There was a car and a driver waiting for us. The biggest border guard, the boss, and I got into the backseat, with me pinned between them.</p> <p><br>The third border guard took the front seat beside the driver. This third border guard was older than the other two. He had a black mustache, and in a lot of ways he looked like my father. Sometimes it seemed to me that the other two did not know he was there the same way I did. He never did talk, and nobody ever talked to him, except me. I did one time.</p> <p><br>I asked whether we were going to the capital, at first in English, and then (when I was pretty sure neither of them understood it) in German. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; the boss border guard told me in German. &#x201c;We go to Puraustays.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>I tried to remember a map I had seen. &#x201c;Puraustays is a long way from the capital.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>&#x201c;No. It is near.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>&#x201c;Two hundred kilometers?&#x201d;</p> <p><br>The boss border guard just shrugged, reached into the pocket sewn onto the back of the seat in front of him, and took out a map. He opened it for me.</p> <p><br>It was small and looked like it had been drawn for kids, with little pictures scattered here and there. I remember a miner and a wild ox. Looking up from it, I said, &#x201c;This says three hundred and twenty kilometers.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>The boss border guard chuckled. &#x201c;All maps are wrong. If the Turks come, they will be lost.&#x201d;<br>We crossed a river that may have been the same river my train had roared across the day before. The little map called it the Taxus. Factories lined its bank, ugly gray buildings with tall chimneys of yellow brick. I asked what they made in there. The boss border guard shrugged, but the biggest of the three told me, &#x201c;Fertilizer.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>The city on the other side of the river was laid out in a way I have never seen anywhere else and had not known they used anywhere. Whether it was a big one or a little one, every building stood on its own block, with narrow streets on all four sides. A lot of these narrow, crooked streets could be called alleys. Some were not even paved. I am going to call them all streets because they use the same word for all of them. The size of the blocks varied depending on the size of the buildings. Large or small, they were mostly square or rectangular. There was always a strip of grass, trees, and shrubs around each building. That seemed to be the law, and it must have been the law there for a long time.</p> <p><br>The variations in size meant that our car (and the wagons and so forth) could not go fast, turning left or right almost at the end of each block. Left turns were followed by rights, and the other way. When we had made half a dozen turns or so, it hit me that all the turns must make it hard to follow a particular street. After that, I watched for street signs, but there were not any. Pretty soon I asked the big man the name of the street we were on. He just shrugged and the boss border guard told me, &#x201c;Our streets do not have names.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>Then I stuck my neck out, saying that no street names must make it hard to find somebody&#x2019;s house. The boss border guard asked me, &#x201c;Why do you want to find somebody&#x2019;s house in Puraustays?&#x201d;</p> <p><br>For a while we threaded our way among old buildings of three, four, or five stories, all of some dark stone. They said the biggest one, with gargoyles and lots of balconies, was the seat of the city&#x2019;s government. The trees around it were so tall I could not see a thing below a story that could have been the fourth or the third. This story, like the ones above it, was impressive and pretty interesting. I remember plants that looked an awful lot like jellyfish, and people who looked a lot like flowers.</p> <p><br>Beyond that was a long yellow brick building with three stories. It was the first building I had seen that looked busy, and it seemed a whole lot busier than just about any building in America, with people hurrying in and out all the time. I asked what it was, and the big guy who had lifted me said, &#x201c;The Mounted Guard.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>I know I must have looked dumb. There were a lot of big doors, but I had seen no horses and no soldiers. The boss border guard told me, &#x201c;They are on duty in the East.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>After a while we got into a suburb or something like that. The streets there were more like those in American towns. The houses were all pretty much the same size, and that meant the blocks were pretty much the same size, too. So the streets were nearly straight except when they bent around.</p> <p><br>Finally we stopped in front of a house that was not quite as big as the others, a little square house of dirty white concrete blocks. Our driver got out and trotted around to open the door for the third border guard. The sky was overcast, there was not a lot of time, and I could not be sure. But it seemed to me that the driver looked like the porter who had made my bed on the train. They could not have been the same guy. Still, they looked a lot alike.</p> <p><br>There was no walk to the front door, only a little path among trees. Except for the driver, we trooped along it, the boss border guard, then the biggest and the third border guard. I limped along behind them, thinking I ought to run away but knowing I would be a darned fool to get separated from my passport. The boss border guard knocked with the barrel of his pistol.<br>A short, stocky man maybe thirty or so answered it, opening the door a crack then closing it again to unfasten a security chain before opening it wide. He had on a clean gray undershirt and gray wool pants that looked too big.</p> <p><br>We crowded in and he talked. I think he was trying to get the boss border guard to sit down in the biggest chair. The boss border guard would not do it and lectured him. After a lot of that, the boss border guard asked me, &#x201c;In Amerika, you build prisons for your prisoners, yes?&#x201d; His German was not even as good as mine, but I understood him and nodded.</p> <p><br>&#x201c;Here we save.&#x201d; The boss border guard chuckled. &#x201c;You are this man&#x2019;s prisoner.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>I said I had not done anything.</p> <p><br>&#x201c;You come without visa, with no passport. These things are sufficient.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>&#x201c;You took my passport,&#x201d; I reminded him. &#x201c;Give it back, please.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>&#x201c;It has been sent to the capital. I cannot give back. Until it is sent back, you have none. You must stay here. You see this man?&#x201d; The boss border guard indicated the short man in the undershirt. </p> <p>&#x201c;Do you like him?&#x201d;</p> <p><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know him.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>&#x201c;So you like him. When you know him better, you do not like him so much, I think.&#x201d; The boss border guard shut one eye and pointed his pistol at the short man&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;When you escape, him we shoot.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>The short man gave me a sad glance.</p> <p><br>&#x201c;You see how nice to you we are. You do not like the food, you say it is rotten, you will go. He give better so you stay. Other things, too.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>I said nothing. I was watching a girl who had peeked around the corner.</p> <p><br>&#x201c;You are to sleep here.&#x201d; Holstering his pistol, the boss border guard took a folded paper and a pen from a poc...</p></p><h2>Shatter</h2><p><p>In Michael Robotham&#x2019;s latest thriller, psychologist Joe O&#x2019;Loughlin&#x2014;the appealing hero of <i>Suspect</i>&#x2014;tries to prevent a suicide and finds himself locked in a deadly duel with a very clever killer. <br><br>Joe O'Loughlin is on familiar territory&#x2014;standing on a bridge high above a flooded gorge, trying to stop a distraught woman from jumping.

The ball made a satisfying sound as it slapped his palm. His legs flopped in a V. His arms stretched up to the ceiling. And the thought that if he missed he&#x2019;d probably break his nose made the game just interesting enough to keep going.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the floor above he heard footsteps&#x2014;his mother&#x2019;s&#x2014;and then a long, loud scraping-groaning sound. He stopped throwing the ball to listen. His mother was dragging something heavy across the kitchen floor. Probably the broken air conditioner.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week ago, right at the beginning of the heat wave, the air conditioner in his mother&#x2019;s attic office had broken. The man from Sears had installed a brand- new one but left the old one sitting right in the middle of the kitchen floor. The Treskis had been walking around it all week.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scra-a-a-ape. Evan stood up. His mom was strong, but this was a two- person job. Hopefully she wouldn&#x2019;t ask him why he was hiding in the dark basement. And hopefully Jessie wouldn&#x2019;t be in the kitchen at all. He&#x2019;d been avoiding her for two days now, and it was getting harder by the minute. The house just wasn&#x2019;t that big.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan had his hand on the railing when the scraping noise stopped. He heard footsteps fading to silence. She&#x2019;d given up. Probably the heat, he thought. It was that kind of weather: giving-up kind of weather.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went back to lying on the floor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thwap. Thwap.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he heard the basement door open. Psssshhh. Evan caught the ball and froze.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Evan?&#x201d; Jessie&#x2019;s voice sounded echo-y in the darkness. &#x201c;Evan? You down there?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan held his breath. He lay completely still. The only thing that moved was the pins-and-needles prickling in his fingers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the door start to close&#x2014;long breath out&#x2014;but then it stopped and opened again. Footsteps on the carpeted stairs. A black outline of Jessie standing on the bottom step with daylight squirting all around her. Evan didn&#x2019;t move a muscle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Evan? Is that you?&#x201d; Jessie took one short step into the basement. &#x201c;Is that . . . ? She inched her way toward him, then kicked him with her bare foot.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Hey! Watch it, would ya?&#x201d; said Evan, swatting her leg. He suddenly felt stupid lying there in the dark.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I thought you were a sleeping bag,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t see. What are you doing down here? How come the lights are off?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s too hot with the lights on,&#x201d; he said. He talked in a flat voice, trying to sound like the most boring person on the whole planet. If he kept it up, Jessie might just leave him alone.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Mom&#x2019;s back in her office,&#x201d; said Jessie, lying down on the couch. &#x201c;Working.&#x201d; She groaned as she said the word.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan didn&#x2019;t say anything. He went back to throwing the ball. Straight up. Straight down. Maybe silence would get Jessie to leave. He was starting to feel words piling up inside him, crowding his lungs, forcing out all the air. It was like having a chestful of bats, beating their wings, fighting to get out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;She tried to move the air conditioner, but it&#x2019;s too heavy,&#x201d; said Jessie.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan tightened up his lips. Go away, he thought. Go away before I say something mean.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s gonna be hot a-a-a-all week,&#x201d; Jessie continued. &#x201c;In the nineties. All the way up &#x2019;til Labor Day.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thwap. Thwap.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;So, whaddya wanna do?&#x201d; Jessie asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scream, thought Evan. Jessie never got it when you were giving her the Big Freeze. She just went right on acting as if everything were great. It made it really hard to tell her to bug off without telling her to BUG OFF! Whenever Evan did that, he felt bad.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;So, whaddya wanna do?&#x201d; Jessie asked again, nudging him with her foot.<br>&amp;nsbp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a direct question. Evan had to answer it or explain why he wouldn&#x2019;t. And he couldn&#x2019;t get into that. It was too . . . too complicated. Too hurtful.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Huh? So, whaddya wanna do?&#x201d; she asked for the third time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Doin&#x2019; it,&#x201d; said Evan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Nah, come on. For real.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;For real,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;We could ride our bikes to the 7-Eleven,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;No money,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You just got ten dollars from Grandma for your birthday.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Spent it,&#x201d; said Evan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;On what?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Stuff,&#x201d; Evan said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ve got . . . well . . . &#x201d; Jessie&#x2019;s voice dribbled down to nothing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan stopped throwing the ball and looked at her. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie pulled her legs tight to her chest. &#x201c;Nothin&#x2019;,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; said Evan. He knew that Jessie had money. Jessie always had money squirreled away in her lock box. But that didn&#x2019;t mean she was going to share it. Evan went back to throwing the baseball. He felt a tiny flame of anger shoot up and lick his face.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thwap. Thwap.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt; &#x201c;We could build a fort in the woods,&#x201d; said Jessie.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Too hot.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;We could play Stratego.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Too boring.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;We could build a track and race marbles.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Too stupid!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thin spider web of sweat draped itself over his foreheaddddd, spreading into his hair. With every throw, he told himself, It&#x2019;s not her fault. But he could feel his anger growing. He started popping his elbow to put a little more juice on the ball. It was flying a good four feet into the air every time. Straight up. Straight down.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pop. Thwap. Pop. Thwap.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bats in his chest were going nuts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What is the matter with you?&#x201d; asked Jessie. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been so weird the last couple of days.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aw, man, here they come.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t wanna play a dumb game like Stratego,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You like Stratego. I only picked that because it&#x2019;s your favorite game. I was being nice, in case you hadn&#x2019;t noticed.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Look. There are only six days left of summer, and I&#x2019;m not going to waste them playing a dumb game.&#x201d; Evan felt his heartbeat speed up. Part of him wanted to stuff a sock in his mouth, and part of him wanted to deck his sister. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a stupid game and it&#x2019;s for babies and I don&#x2019;t want to play a stupid baby game.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pop. Thwap. Pop. Thwap.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Why are you being so mean?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan knew he was being mean, and he hated being mean, especially to her. But he couldn&#x2019;t help it. He was so angry and so humiliated and so full of bats, there was nothing else he could be. Except alone. And she&#x2019;d taken even that away from him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the genius,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You figure it out.&#x201d; Good. That would shut her up. For once! Evan watched the ball fly in the air.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Is this because of the letter?&#x201d; Jessie asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crack.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan had taken his eyes off the ball for one second, just for one second, and the ball came crashing down on his nose.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Crud! Oh, CRUD!&#x201d; He curled over onto his side, grabbing his nose with both hands. There was a blinding, blooming pain right behind his eyes that was quickly spreading to the outer edges of his skull.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Do you want some ice?&#x201d; he heard Jessie ask in a calm voice.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Whaddya think?&#x201d; he shouted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; She stood up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t want any stupid ice.&#x201d; The pain was starting to go away, like a humungous wave that crashes with a lot of noise and spray but then slowly fizzles away into nothing. Evan rolled to a sitting position and took his hands away from his nose. With his thumb and index finger, he started to pinch the bridge. Was it still in a straight line?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie peered at his face in the dim light. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not bleeding,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah, well it, hurts!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;A lot!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not broken,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know that,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know everything, you know. You think you do, but you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not even swollen. You&#x2019;re making a big deal out of nothing.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evan held his nose with one hand and hit his sister&#x2019;s knee with the other. Then he picked up the baseball and struggled to his feet. &#x201c;Leave me alone. I came down here to get away from you and you just had to follow. You ruin everything. You ruined my summer and now you&#x2019;re going to ruin school. I hate you.&#x201d; When he got to the bottom of the steps, he threw the baseball down in disgust.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thud.</p></p><h2>A Christmas Promise (Cape Light, Book 5)</h2><p>Arriving in Cape Light to spend the holidays, James McDougal, a minister who runs a mission in Central America, finds himself falling for fellow visitor Leigh Baxter, a young woman searching for a hiding place from the dark secrets of the past, after they meet each other in an automobile accident during the area&#39;s first snowfall.</p><p>Thomas Kinkade is America's most collected artist, a painter-communicator whose tranquil, light-infused paintings bring hope and joy to millions each year. <br><br> Katherine Spencer was a fiction editor before turning to a full-time career as a writer. She is the author of more than 20 books.A pregnant woman finds love after fleeing from her abusive ex-husband in this syrupy holiday concoction from Kinkade and Spencer, which is set in Kinkade's familiar New England locale of Cape Light, Mass. Leigh Baxter has a jarring first encounter with the idyllic coastal village when her trip through a snow storm leads to a collision with the local minister, James Cameron, a missionary who has returned home from Nicaragua to recover from malaria. Cameron finds Baxter a place to stay with his landlady while her car is repaired, and initially Baxter sticks to her story about being newly widowed. But her trip was actually triggered by her ex-husband, Martin Garret, a corrupt, brutal corporate mogul who abused her during their marriage and promised to use his wealth and power to get custody of their child. Cameron and Baxter's budding romance is as predictable as the lyrics of a Christmas carol, but the narrative pace turns positively glacial once Baxter settles in town as the local doctor's receptionist. A few ineffective subplots fill in the gaps until Garret's detective tracks down Baxter, and she must tell Cameron her real story. The cast of characters is engaging and well-drawn, but the combination of leaden, generic scenes and a formulaic story line make this the literary equivalent of a holiday fruitcake in February: sweet but stale. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

If you find yourself tormented by unwanted, disturbing thoughts or compelled to perform rigidly set action to reduce your stress, you may be one of the millions of Americans who suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It may be as mild a doubting whether you tumed off the iron before leaving the house, or it may be as sever as disabling as washing your hands for hours each day. But whatever its degree, OCD is distressing, uncomfortable, and can disrupt your life or destroy your most important relationships. Until recently, OCD was considered to be almost untreatable using conventional forms of therapy. Now it is known to be a highly treatable disorder using behavior therapy. Drs. Foa and Wilson, internationally known authorities on the treatment of anxiety disorders, have developed a revolutionary self-help program that can help relieve crippling obsessions and compulsions. In <i>Stop Obsessing!</i> you will discover: A series of questionnaires to help you analyze the severity of your obsessions and compulsions.

Gray ash, blown into ripples, exposed an old campfire ring. On the edges of the clearing the ash melded into gray hills, low and still in death. Black spikes, the last rebellion of living trees, thrust up through the misery of destruction. <br>Giving God the finger, Charles thought. Never a good idea. Like most Catholics, Charles prayed to Jesus and Mother Mary when he bothered to pray. Jesus was in the redemption business. Not God; God was in the smiting business. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;re we gonna do, Dude?&#x201d; <br>Charles slid his eyes toward the Fox River. The fire had been stopped by the water. Its final act of destruction was the campground. On the far bank, vegetation was a lush mockery; verdant greens, rich golds, and loud reds thrust out over the water like so many jeering faces. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;re we gonna do, Dude?&#x201d; repeated the goon, slouching between Charles and the river. <br>Known facts automatically played in Charles&#x2019;s mind: Sean Ferris, small-time muscle. Philadelphia, Chicago, then Detroit. Served three years for rape. Obedient, loyal. Attack dog. Ferris was old for this work, and fat. The black leather coat and pointed-toe boots stuck him in the sixties, too overdone even to pass for retro. <br>Charles took his cell phone from the pocket of the blanket coat and pushed the number three. <br>&#x201c;Calling Mr. Big?&#x201d; asked another of the goons Bernie had stuck him with. <br>James R. Spinks, forty-one years of age, out of Detroit, Michigan, connected to what passed for Mafia. Scum for hire. IQ of 84. Went by the name Jimmy. Grown men who liked to be called by little boys&#x2019; names needed to be hung by their tiny dicks, Charles thought. <br>Bernie picked up on the second ring. The fool must be hunched over the phone, waiting for news of his cunning foray into crime. <br>&#x201c;Campground is burned,&#x201d; Charles said. &#x201c;Nothing to acquire.&#x201d; The job was supposed to be a clean smash-and-grab. Bernie, <i>Mr. Big,</i> hadn&#x2019;t done his homework. The fool actually believed Charles had no idea who was the so-called brains behind this caper. Bernard Iverson, forty-six, Edmondson, Canada, marine equipment, massively overextended, net worth five million dollars and still not worth the bullet it would take to kill him. <br>&#x201c;One second, please,&#x201d; Bernie said. <br>Unblinking, Charles waited, listening to a clatter that suggested Bernie was using his cell phone as a hockey puck. He gritted his teeth, his jaw muscles bunched into hard knots. This was the only outward show of emotion he allowed himself. Humans were masters at reading faces. A second&#x2019;s hesitation, a flick of the eyes, a smile at the wrong time telegraphed weakness. Even people who didn&#x2019;t understand what they were seeing retained enough feral instinct to home in on any chink in the armor. From that day forth they hammered at it until the chink became a crack and the crack a break. Once the soft flesh was exposed they went for the entrails with talons and tongues as sharp as harpies&#x2019;. <br>The only earth the meek inherited was six feet down and capped by a stone. <br>A final scrimmage and Bernie was back. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a second campsite about four miles north on the same side of the river. It looks like it didn&#x2019;t burn. They probably stopped there.&#x201d; <br>Charles kept waiting. Four miles, no trail, probably: not good enough. The whole setup was Mickey Mouse. Bernie didn&#x2019;t know Charles, but Charles knew him. Michael had once said the so-called <i>Mr. Big</i> was nickel and dime, undermining unions, cutting corners, slighting on materials. That was why they&#x2019;d bought him out. When it came to fundamental criminal activities, Charles doubted if he could steal a peek at a nudist camp. Given half a day, Charles could have come up with a better crew than Bernie&#x2019;s bottom-feeders. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get a bird&#x2019;s-eye&#x2019;s and call you back,&#x201d; Bernie said finally. <br>Charles punched the disconnect. Jimmy, dressed in a coat identical to the one Charles wore, but with a matching hat and earflaps, spit a stream of tobacco juice into the ash. Mostly into the ash; a drop or two of spittle remained in the Ted Kaczynski&#x2013;style beard he sported. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the deal?&#x201d; Jimmy asked. His teeth were stained brown. <br>Charles looked away. &#x201c;The target may be four miles upriver. The pilot&#x2019;s doing a flyby. We wait here until we have a positive ID.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then what?&#x201d; This from Reg. <br>Reginald Waters, African American, thirty-one, Detroit. Ex-gangbanger, low-end drug dealer, con man. Into bookies for a hundred and seventy-three grand. Last call for repayment before the bad boys came for him. <br>&#x201c;If the target is located, we move to acquire it,&#x201d; Charles said without looking at Waters. Eye contact was an invitation to intimacy. Flee, fight, fornicate, or, Charles&#x2019;s least favorite, ask stupid questions. Open honest intercourse was not a paradigm for leadership that appealed to him. <br>&#x201c;Even with others he works alone.&#x201d; <br>Charles&#x2019;s brother had said that. A photograph of Michael clicked onto the screen in Charles&#x2019;s mind, the black-and-white glossy taken for his senior yearbook. Next to it appeared the picture of the target lifted from the Internet. <br>Payback is going to be a bitch, Charles promised his little brother. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Nevada Barr <br></p><h2>Glass Beads from Europe: With Value Guide (Schiffer Book for Collectors)</h2><p>The various worldwide uses of glass beads, from antiquity to the modern time, are presented in this new book, along with the fascinating evolution of the beadmaking industry.

She is a RITA Award winner and lives in New York City.<b>Chapter One</b><p>London, 1806</p><p>&#x201c;They say he&#x2019;s a vampire.&#x201d;</p><p>Sally Fitzhugh&#x2019;s friend Agnes trotted after her as Sally made a beeline for the French doors to the garden, driven by a restlessness she couldn&#x2019;t entirely explain. Behind her, she could hear the scraping of the musicians, the swish of fashionable fans. She just wanted out. Away from the heat, away from the smells, away from the petty gossip and murmurings.</p><p>It was October, and cold, but the ballroom was humid with the press of too many bodies in too small a place. The very mirrors seemed fogged with it, blurred and distorted. Even with her arms and neck bare, Sally felt uncomfortably warm in her silk and gauze gown.</p><p>The crisp October air hit Sally like a tonic, and, with it, Agnes&#x2019;s words. Had Agnes really said&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;A what?&#x201d;</p><p>Agnes ducked the rapidly swinging door. &#x201c;A bloodsucking creature of the night,&#x201d; she said helpfully as she followed Sally out towards the balustrade, away from the crush in Lord Vaughn&#x2019;s ballroom.</p><p>&#x201c;I know what a vampire is. Everyone knows what they are.&#x201d; Ever since The Convent of Orsino (by a Lady) had taken the town by storm the previous spring, the ladies of the ton had become intimate experts on the topic. The men, just as sickeningly, had taken to powdering their faces pale and affecting red lip rouge. Sally found it distinctly ridiculous.</p><p>But, then, she was finding it all a little ridiculous just now: the too strong perfumes, the smug smiles, the whispering voices behind fans, the incredible arrogance of those powdered fops and perspiring ladies. It would serve them right if there were vampires in their midst. Not that such things existed, of course. Any bloodsucking that went on in the ton was purely of the metaphorical variety, although none the less draining for that.</p><p>Sally gripped the cool stone of the balustrade with both hands, breathing in deeply through her nose. She wasn&#x2019;t sure what ailed her. Back in the cloistered confines of Miss Climpson&#x2019;s Select Seminary, she had been itching to try her wings on the world, to flirt and laugh and bend beaux to her will. She knew exactly what it would be like: a cross between a Samuel Richardson novel and those notices one read in the paper, the ones that began with &#x201c;Lady A&#x2014; wore a gown of watered green silk.&#x201d; She would be the toast of London, taking the town by storm.</p><p>And why shouldn&#x2019;t she? She was, she knew, without false modesty, more than passably attractive. Quite a bit more, really. It didn&#x2019;t do to be disingenuous about such things. So what if Martin Frobisher called her a gilded beanpole? He was just sore because she made him look like the sniveling little thing he was&#x2014;and jealous because his family hadn&#x2019;t two guineas to rub together. Proud, he called her. Well, yes, she was proud. She knew her own worth, both in character and in coin. What did it matter that her family had never thrown down a cloak for Elizabeth I or provided a mistress for Charles II? Just because they had never toadied for a title didn&#x2019;t mean that they weren&#x2019;t as good as anyone. They were certainly a sure sight better-looking, and her dowry was as big as anyone&#x2019;s.</p><p>Both of those, Sally knew, guaranteed her entr�e into society&#x2014;or her brother&#x2019;s name wasn&#x2019;t Turnip.</p><p>She had sallied off to London in the firm anticipation of champagne-filled evenings of compliments, in which she would hold court among her devoted and witty admirers.</p><p>Well, she had been right about the champagne, at least. She just hadn&#x2019;t expected it to taste quite so sour.</p><p>Even so, it was better than ratafia, the drink of young ladies, of which she had imbibed enough over the past year and a half to float a medium-sized royal barge. To be honest, she hadn&#x2019;t minded the ratafia at the first. And if her admirers were less witty and more waspish&#x2014;well, she was too busy flirting her fan and enjoying her own wit to mind. It was only bit by bit, along the course of her first Season, that she began to realize that it all felt a little flat. The bright silks and satins looked best by candlelight, where the stains didn&#x2019;t show. The glittering jewels were too often paste. The fashionable gossip, which had seemed so terribly clever and scandalous in that first month, became nothing more than the endless repetition of a series of painfully similar on dits.</p><p>Did it really matter that Lucy Ponsonby had been seen without her gloves at Lady Beaufeatheringstone&#x2019;s latest ball? It was hardly a matter of international policy.</p><p>She was just in a mood, she told herself. Tired, cranky, weary. Too many nights of too many entertainments that weren&#x2019;t all that entertaining. It would get better. It had to get better. She didn&#x2019;t like feeling like this, so purposeless. So restless.</p><p>She had hoped that having her friends Lizzy and Agnes join her this year would help, that introducing them to society would provide some of the vim that she had felt last year, when it was all fresh and new. But Agnes didn&#x2019;t care much for such things, and Lizzy had rapidly, without much help from Sally, acquired her own circle.</p><p>Lizzy had, in fact, become something of a minor sensation in her own right. Part of it was due to her stepmother, Mrs. Reid. Mrs. Reid&#x2019;s novel, The Convent of Orsino, was the topic of conversation at all select soirees, her presence a coup for any hostess. People fought to send cards to her stepdaughter, in the hope that Mrs. Reid might attend, and&#x2014;even better!&#x2014;lose her temper and pink someone with her infamous sword parasol. A wound from Mrs. Reid was a sure sign of social success. But while Mrs. Reid&#x2019;s notoriety might have garnered Lizzy the invitations, the rest she had achieved on her own. At any party, one could find Lizzy surrounded by a fascinated group of men and women, telling hair-raising tales of her youth in India. Given that Lizzy had left India at the age of six, and spent the rest of her formative years first with a retired vicar&#x2019;s wife and then in the decidedly unexotic confines of Miss Climpson&#x2019;s Select Seminary, Sally strongly suspected that the larger part of those stories were apocryphal, taken right out of the novels they had smuggled under the covers at Miss Climpson&#x2019;s. Not that that made any difference to her audience.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t hurt that the rumor had made its way around the ton that Lizzy&#x2019;s mother had been an Indian princess, complete with elephant and priceless jewels.</p><p>It was Sally who had started the rumor about Lizzy&#x2019;s mother being an Indian princess. Not the elephants. The elephants had come later, along with other embellishments that made the originator of the tale raise her brows and wrinkle her nose. People did come up with the most ridiculous things. . . .</p><p>But, still, it was all better than the truth, which was that Lizzy&#x2019;s mother had been a bazaar girl. A touch of royal blood rendered Lizzy interesting and exotic; without it, she would be stigmatized as nothing but the bastard brat of an insignificant East India Company Colonel of little fortune and no birth. That was what Sally had reckoned when she started the rumor.</p><p>Of course, she hadn&#x2019;t reckoned on it running away from her like that.</p><p>She hadn&#x2019;t reckoned on being left behind.</p><p>That was silly. It wasn&#x2019;t as though Lizzy had left her. They still spent a great deal of time together. It was just . . . When Sally had left Miss Climpson&#x2019;s for London, it had never occurred to her that Agnes and Lizzy would carry on without her, turning their trio into a duo. They had even had an adventure of their own&#x2014;not that it was terribly much of an adventure, given that Lizzy and Agnes had run off the moment there was a hint of a French spy on the scene, disappearing for weeks and causing everyone a lot of bother finding them again. If Sally had been there, they would have routed the spy on their own, and saved everyone a great deal of trouble.</p><p>But she hadn&#x2019;t been there. As they had reminded her countless times. Not always intentionally, but in little ways&#x2014;in jokes she didn&#x2019;t understand and in memories she didn&#x2019;t share. Sally was used to being the leader of their little trio. It felt very odd to be rendered de trop.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;inconvenient diet,&#x201d; Agnes was saying. &#x201c;Blood does stain so.&#x201d;</p><p>Belatedly, Sally pulled her attention back to Agnes. Unlike Sally, Agnes did not seem to be enjoying the cool night air. Her teeth were chattering slightly and her skin was turning a faint shade of blue that matched the color of her gown.</p><p>&#x201c;Here,&#x201d; Sally said, and took the light shawl from her own shoulders and wrapped it around Agnes, who hadn&#x2019;t had the sense to bring her own. &#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The rumors,&#x201d; said Agnes, blinking innocently at Sally as she absently tucked the corners of the wrap beneath her arms. &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t you heard? They say he&#x2019;s a vampire.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A vampire? Hardly.&#x201d; Sally paused to glower in the general direction of the ballroom. There was no love lost between her and their host. Lord Vaughn was not an admirer of Sally&#x2019;s brother, Turnip, which meant that Sally was not an admirer of Lord Vaughn. No one but Sally was allowed to insult Turnip. Still, even so . . . &#x201c;Whatever else I may think of the man, Lord Vaughn looks perfectly corporeal to me. Those waistcoats are just an affectation.&#x201d;</p><p>It would be just like Lord Vaughn to set himself up as an undead creature of the night. He prided himself on being slightly sinister, going about in those black waistcoats with silver serpents, murmuring cryptic comments. It was, reflected Sally critically, all just a little too obvious.</p><p>&#x201c;Not Lord Vaughn,&#x201d; said Agnes patiently. &#x201c;The Duke of Belliston.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Duke of Who?&#x201d; Lizzy joined them on the balcony, her bronze curls escaping from a wreath of flowers that had gone askew, like the halo of a naughty angel. There was a healthy glow in her cheeks and her brown eyes were bright.</p><p>&#x201c;Belliston,&#x201d; said Agnes, palpably unaware of any social frissons or fissures. &#x201c;In the house across the garden.&#x201d;</p><p>She gestured in the other direction, away from the crowded ballroom, past long rows of perfectly trimmed parterres.</p><p>Even in the waning season of the year, Lord Vaughn&#x2019;s shrubbery didn&#x2019;t have a leaf out of place. The garden was arranged in the French style, all gravel paths and geometric designs, scorning the more natural wilderness gardens coming into vogue. Above the close-clipped hedges and the marble statues glimmering white in the moonlight, Sally could just make out the outline of the great house across the way.</p><p>Unlike Lord Vaughn&#x2019;s, that garden had been allowed to run to seed, by either accident or design. Weeping willows trailed ghostly fingers over the dim outline of a pond on which no swans swam, while ivy climbed the walls of the house, dangling from the balconies, obscuring the windows. In the heart of London, the edifice had an eerie air of isolation.</p><p>It was the largest house in the square, larger by far than Lord Vaughn&#x2019;s. Sally felt a certain satisfaction at that thought. Lord Vaughn could put on all the airs he liked, but he still wasn&#x2019;t the biggest fish in the square. And by fish, she meant duke. The Duke of Belliston out-housed and outranked Vaughn.</p><p>He was also remarkably elusive. In her two Seasons in society, Sally had never met the man. There was some sort of story about him . . . something to do with a curse and his parents.</p><p>But vampires? Nonsense.</p><p>&#x201c;Is that Belliston House?&#x201d; Lizzy shook back her curls as she stared avidly at the house across the way. &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t realized we were so close to the Lair of the Vampire.&#x201d;</p><p>Sally rolled her eyes at the idiocy of mankind. &#x201c;Vampires are a myth. And not a particularly interesting one,&#x201d; she added repressively.</p><p>&#x201c;People said the same thing about the Duke of Belliston,&#x201d; Agnes pointed out. &#x201c;About his being a myth, I mean. But you can&#x2019;t deny there are lights in the windows.&#x201d;</p><p>That much was true. Through the ivy and the dust, a faint but distinct light shone.</p><p>&#x201c;She has you there,&#x201d; said Lizzy. There was no denying that someone was in residence at Belliston House. Whoever&#x2014;or whatever&#x2014;that someone might be.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but . . .&#x201d; Sally made an impatient gesture with her hands. &#x201c;Next you&#x2019;ll be telling me you saw a bat flying around his belfry.&#x201d;</p><p>Lizzy cocked her head, considering the urns that lined the roof of the house. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s a crow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you know what a group of crows is called?&#x201d; Agnes&#x2019;s voice dropped to a hushed whisper. &#x201c;The collective term for a group of crows is&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, no,&#x201d; said Sally.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;a murder,&#x201d; Agnes finished earnestly.</p><p>As an academic appellation it was just a little too atmospheric, especially with the moon silhouetted against the chimney pots, casting strange shadows through the abandoned garden. Sally felt a chill shiver its way down her spine, beneath the thin fabric of her gown and chemise.</p><p>Catching Lizzy&#x2019;s too-knowing eye, she hastily looked away, wishing she hadn&#x2019;t parted with her shawl.</p><p>There was no call for Lizzy to look at her that way. Chills were simply what one got when one stood on a balcony in a scoop-necked ball gown in the middle of October. It had nothing at all to do with the black bird flapping about the chimney pots.</p><p>Somewhere in the depths of the garden, an owl voiced its mournful cry.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x201d;&#x2014;Sally cast about for a suitably dampening adjective&#x2014;&#x201c;is absurd.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, truly,&#x201d; said Agnes. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a murder of crows and an unkindness of ravens.&#x201d;</p><p>That last, at least, was appropriate. Sally cast a glance back over her shoulder at the ballroom. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d say it&#x2019;s more an affectation of imbeciles.&#x201d;</p><p>Lizzy grinned at her. &#x201c;You sound like my stepmother.&#x201d; Before Sally could decide whether that was an insult or not, Lizzy turned her attention back to the dark shell of Belliston House. Leaning her elbows on the balustrade, she said with relish, &#x201c;They say he sucks the blood of unwary maidens.&#x201d;</p><p>Agnes considered this. &#x201c;I imagine they&#x2019;re less trouble than wary ones.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Utter rubbish,&#x201d; said Sally crisply. Before Agnes could argue with her, she added quickly, &#x201c;Just because the man scorns society doesn&#x2019;t mean that he&#x2019;s an unholy creature of the night.&#x201d;</p><p>In fact, at the moment she would say it was rather a sign of his good sense.</p><p>&#x201c;No one has seen him for seven years,&#x201d; Lizzy pointed out. &#x201c;Or was it ten? That&#x2019;s rather a long time for societal scorning unless he had some other motive in mind.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Such as draining the blood of wary or unwary maidens?&#x201d; Sally gave a delicate sniff. &#x201c;I think not.&#x201d;</p><p>Agnes&#x2019;s face took on the distant look it acquired when she was parsing a difficult academic question. &#x201c;Seven is a mystical number. . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So is three,&#x201d; said Sally. &#x201c;Or five hundred and thirty-two.&#x201d; She had no idea about five hundred and thirty-two, but someone had to show a bit of sense. Sally pushed away from the balcony, her gauze overskirt catching on the carved edge of an acanthus leaf. &#x201c;Whatever the Duke of Belliston is, he&#x2019;s just a man.&#x201d;</p><p>Lizzy&#x2019;s eyes glinted with mischief. &#x201c;Prove it,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>Agnes looked in alarm from Lizzy to Sally and back again. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t mean&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Lizzy nodded decisively. &#x201c;Someone ought to go over there. In the interest of truth, of course.&#x201d; Her face was a picture of guileless innocence as she added delicately, &#x201c;Unless, of course, you don&#x2019;t care to go.&#x201d;</p><p>They had played this game so many times before, i...</p></p><h2>American Ginseng: Green Gold</h2><p>Revised edition of 'a grower's guide, including ginseng's history &amp; use.</p><p></p><h2>Broken Glass</h2><p>Alain Mabanckou&#x2019;s riotous new novel centers on the patrons of a run-down bar in the Congo. In a country that appears to have forgotten the importance of remembering, a former schoolteacher and bar regular nicknamed Broken Glass has been elected to record their stories for posterity. But Broken Glass fails spectacularly at staying out of trouble as one denizen after another wants to rewrite history in an attempt at making sure his portrayal will properly reflect their exciting and dynamic lives. Despondent over this apparent triumph of self-delusion over self-awareness, Broken Glass drowns his sorrows in red wine and riffs on the great books of Africa and the West.

Melissa McClements, <i>Financial Times</i><br><br> Mabanckou . . . positions himself at the margins, tapping the tradition founded by Celine, Genet and other subversive writers.

She kept a diary ``of my fifth and sixth year,'' during which she stayed home from school to do laundry for ``the mama where I live,'' who found her a ``nuisance'' and frequently struck her; made pets of a crow (``Lars Porsena''), a mouse (``Felix Mendelssohn''), and several other animals; confided in a ``grand'' tree (``...Michael Raphael...He has an understanding soul'') and mourned when it was felled; visited a girl with ``no seeing,'' who enjoyed the flowers she brought; and wondered whether ``Kind God'' might allow her parents to be her ``Guardian Angels.'' Boulton, a poet who (according to the jacket) is the ``author'' of ``a full adaptation of Opal's diary,'' is cited by LC as author of this book, but according to the publisher these quaint, naive, wonderfully telling words are Opal's own, selected from the complete diary as it has survived. A note explains that the original was torn into ``a million pieces'' by a stepsister, then pieced together and published in the 20's--a tantalizing glimpse of Opal's subsequent life, otherwise unrevealed here. Cooney's illustrations are perfect--delicate and beautifully observed, her misty landscapes make an elegant setting for a thoughtful, sturdy child, finding her gentle but indomitable way among strangers who have no conception of her true quality. A touching, fascinating portrait. (Autobiography/Picture book. 4+) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Ages 6-9. The inner life of children, long ignored in accounts of pioneer history, is here given an unforgettable voice. Opal was five years old when her parents died, and she went to live with a foster family in a lumber camp in Oregon at the turn of the century. She was just learning to print, and she wrote about her life on scraps of paper, in her own solemn idiom, words of simple intensity. An afterword explains that the poetry in this picture book has been selected from Opal's childhood diary, which was published when she grew up. Opal calls her foster mother "the mama" ("The mama where I live says I am a nuisance . . . the mama likes to have her house nice and clean"). Cooney's clear, beautifully detailed watercolor paintings show the sturdy, solitary child, who imagines her own secret, mischievous world even while she's up to her elbows scrubbing laundry. Whenever she can, Opal escapes into the woods, and she finds her home there. She makes up names for her special companions: for example, her pet mouse is Felix Mendelssohn and her sheltering tree is Michael Raphael. When Michael Raphael is cut down, Opal's lament is a poem of tearing grief ("There was a queer feel in my throat / and I couldn't stand up"); and Cooney's double-page-spread painting shows the rich woodland, the crouching child, and the huge quivering tree crashed to earth. The story ends with Opal once again having to move and leave behind what she loves. Older readers might go on from this diary to read more about Opal and children like her. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Labrava</h2><p>In Miami to photograph the locals, former Secret Service agent and freelance paparazzo Joe LaBrava becomes involved in murder and mayhem when he meets once-famous actress Jean Shaw</p><p>Joe La Brava is an ex-Secret Service agent who gets mixed up in a South Miami Beach scam involving a redneck former cop, a Cuban hit man who moonlights as a go-go dancer, and a one-time movie queen whose world is part make-believe, part deadly dangerous.

Fine, A fine copy, almost as new with matching dustjacket. Vanished Kingdoms: the History of Half-forgotten Europe. 6.5&#34;x9.2&#34;x2.2&#34;; 3.2 lb. . . .</p><p>Norman Davies was for many years a professor at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, London University. He is the author of the acclaimed Vanished Kingdoms and the number one bestseller Europe: A History. His previous books, which include Rising &#39;44, The Isles: A History and God&#39;s Playground: A History of Poland, have been translated worldwide. He has researched at universities from Harvard to Hokkaido, and is a Fellow of the British Academy, an Honorary Fellow of St Antony&#39;s College, Oxford, and a visiting scholar at Pembroke College, Cambridge.A dozen-plus examples from European history constitute this ruminative disquisition on the impermanence of polities. Struck by popular amnesia about the existence of his selections, some of which endured for centuries (although one, the Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine, lived but one day), Davies, from a traveler&#x2019;s viewpoint, describes the contemporary appearance of each former state&#x2019;s territory or principal city, then applies engrossing clarity to the history of its origin, ascent, and decline. Two states en route to expiration, Prussia and Savoy, left traces in contemporary Germany and Italy, but the rest are gone, submerged by dynastic politics, as were the duchy of Burgundy and the kingdom of Aragon, or hacked away and conquered by aggressive neighbors, as was the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth. Despite the subject of extinction, pessimism does not pervade Davies&#x2019; accounts, which detect a persistence of popular memory about each vanished state, encouraging advocates for its revival, as occurred in the cases of Poland and Lithuania. Having current relevance especially to the UK and Montenegro, Davies&#x2019; fascinating work harbors insights and discoveries for avid history readers. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>Frontier Woman: The Life of a Woman Homesteader on the Dakota Frontier</h2><p>retold from the original notes and letters of Grace Fairchild, a Wisconsin teacher, who went to South Dakota in 1898.</p><p></p><h2>Victoria: Intimate Home: Creating a Private World</h2><p>Shows how to decorate bedrooms, baths, and other private spaces in the home in a subtle and soothing country style</p><p>A Bathroom Trimmed in Sentiment <p>It was the bathroom that seduced a couple into buying a graceful old house outside of St. Louis.

By the author of Hattie Baked a Wedding Cake.</p><p>Ages 4^-7. For all those who ever wondered why the cow jumped over the moon, here's the answer in a fresh and funny picture book that soars through the sky on the strength of Speed's explosive (mostly) rhyming text. Millie and Maude are two cool cows from Huckabuck farm, heading to the mountaintop, the best jumping off spot for the moon. Wearing black button-back boots purloined from the Huckabuck kids (who are following them apace), M and M hit the moon and its tasty meadow, where there are "cows in the craters, / cows and their cousins, / cows on vacation, dozens and dozens." The fun's not just in the meadow munching, but also in activities, like doing the Bunny Hop with bovine buddies. Meanwhile, back home, the Huckabuck kids are railing at the moon, still waiting for those shoes. This tale needs some pretty dynamic art, and Root comes through with motion-filled spreads featuring two black-and-white, shades-wearing cows. He catches all the humor, too; each out-of-this-world picture is a smile provoker. (See the <i>Booklist</i> cover, May 1, 1995.) Fun to read aloud, but watch out--little ones just might feel the urge to do some jumping over the moon themselves. <i>Ilene Cooper</i>Those wanting to know why the cow jumped over the moon will find some tweakingly twisted answers in this nonsensical story. "Two cool, too cool" cows from the Huckabuck farm are looking for fresh grass, and they jump to the moon to find it. The moon is cool, too-with cows aplenty beating bongo drums and doing the bunny hop. But the two cool cows are wearing new "black button-back boots" belonging to the four Huckabuck kids, who call them home for milking time. The kids are pleased: Kate plays the fiddle, little Doug laughs and Daisy runs off with Spoon. Speed (Hattie Baked a Wedding Cake) gleefully and rhythmically subverts the nursery classic. And Root (Those Bottles!; Wan Hu Is in the Stars, reviewed below) plays along zestily, coloring the Huckabuck farm with quiet, pastel tints and the moon with rich, jazzy tones-some of which "return" with the cows. A rewarding romp.

Before going to law school, he worked in the business world as a management consultant and a software entrepreneur.<b>1</b><br> <b>The Best of All Possible Worlds<br></b><br>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was one of the most brilliant people of any age&#x2014;an inventor of calculus, an expert in virtually all of the natural sciences, and a pioneer of modern philosophy. One of his central preoccupations, however, was a fundamentally religious question: If God is both benevolent and all-powerful, why do evil and suffering exist? In his 1710 <i>Theodicy, </i>Leibniz answered, &#x201c;There is an infinitude of possible worlds among which God must needs have chosen the best, since he does nothing with�out acting in accordance with supreme reason.&#x201d; If a better world were possible, God would have created that one instead; there�fore, we live in the best of all possible worlds.<br>&nbsp;<br>Unfortunately for Leibniz, his philosophy is best known as the subject of Voltaire&#x2019;s satirical novel <i>Candide, </i>a manifesto of the French Enlightenment. In Voltaire&#x2019;s story, Pangloss proves to his student Candide that we live in the &#x201c;best of all possible worlds,&#x201d; and Candide cheerfully repeats the mantra &#x201c;all is for the best&#x201d; as he suffers an increasingly fantastic succession of misfortunes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Voltaire was mocking not just Leibniz but also the use of reli�gion to justify the social order of the time. Early modern Europe was a world of widespread material hardship in which a privileged few lived in relative comfort while the masses struggled to make ends meet&#x2014;an archaic order that was upended by the French Revolution of 1789. If you were a landowning aristocrat in pre�revolutionary Europe&#x2014;when the &#x201c;1 percent&#x201d; owned something like 60 percent of everything there was to own&#x2014;how would you have explained the vast gulf in living standards between you and the common people? You might not have been a strict Leibniz�ian Optimist, but most likely you would have taken refuge in a religious understanding of the social order. Depending on your denomination, you might have believed that the socioeconomic hierarchy was dictated by God or that the virtuous poor would earn their just deserts in a kingdom to come. According to the sociologist Max Weber, we owe the rise of capitalism to Calvinist Protestants who saw their material success as proof of their per�sonal salvation. One way or another, religion provided a ready justification for a vastly unequal society.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fast-forward to the late nineteenth century. The Western world has been utterly transformed by industrialization and the growth of the urban working class. But society once again appears dominated by a small number of extraordinarily wealthy families with names like Rockefeller, Carnegie, Mellon, and Morgan. On the eve of World War I, the 1 percent own more than 40 percent of total wealth in the United States. If you are a rich industrial�ist living in a Hudson Valley mansion, how do you rationalize an economic system that allows you and your peers to live like French monarchs while books like <i>How the Other Half Lives </i>are exposing the squalor of urban slums?<br>&nbsp;<br>In a post-Enlightenment world, traditional religion is unlikely to do the trick. Instead, you can appeal to modern science in the form of Darwinian evolution, metaphorically applied to human society. Herbert Spencer, who was enormously influential in the United States after the Civil War, claimed that societal evolution required the &#x201c;survival of the fittest&#x201d;: &#x201c;the poverty of the inca�pable, the distresses that come upon the imprudent, the starva�tion of the idle, and those shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong&#x201d; all ultimately serve the long-term progress of humanity. William Graham Sumner translated this doctrine into a celebra�tion of the wealthy: &#x201c;[The millionaires] may fairly be regarded as the naturally selected agents of society for certain work. They get high wages and live in luxury, but the bargain is a good one for society.&#x201d; Any attempt to tinker with this natural order of things would be doomed to failure. For the businessmen who emerged victorious from the &#x201c;evolutionary&#x201d; struggle, this worldview pro�vided a convenient justification for their riches and social stand�ing. In the words of the historian Richard Hofstadter, Social Darwinism &#x201c;was seized upon as a welcome addition, perhaps the most powerful of all, to the store of ideas to which solid and conservative men appealed when they wished to reconcile their fel�lows to some of the hardships of life.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Now fast-forward to today. Across the developed world, vast fortunes are again ascendant. In the United States, the top 1 per�cent take home a larger share of total income than at any time except the late 1920s. The total wealth of the world&#x2019;s billionaires has quadrupled in the past two decades (even when the definition of &#x201c;billionaire&#x201d; is adjusted for inflation). The signs of excess are visible everywhere, from Stephen Schwarzman&#x2019;s $3 million birthday party to Bill Ackman&#x2019;s $90 million New York apartment that he doesn&#x2019;t plan to live in. In the meantime, ordinary people are struggling. In the United States, the average family makes only 8 percent more money (after adjusting for inflation) than it did in the early 1970s, and even that meager increase is due to the fact that more people work today, whether by choice or by necessity; median income for men has actually fallen. In the 1950s, a typical CEO of a large company took home as much money as twenty average employees; today he makes as much as two hundred workers. The percentage of families in poverty has remained essentially unchanged for the past half century. A ris�ing tide no longer lifts all boats.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you are a Wall Street master of the universe or a billionaire hedge fund manager, you face the same challenge as the aristo�crats and industrialists of centuries past: How do you justify the vast economic chasm that separates you from the people you pass on the street every day? Appeals to Christian theology or evolutionary necessity are unlikely to be convincing today. Instead, you can turn to another source of absolute truth: Economics 101. According to an introductory economics class, each person&#x2019;s income is equal to her marginal product: you are necessarily paid the value of your work. Inequality simply reflects the fact that some people are smarter, more skilled, or more hardworking than others. Tinkering with the natural distribution of income&#x2014;say, through taxes&#x2014;would reduce the incentive to work, making everyone worse off. The law of supply and demand ensures that all resources are put to their optimal use, maximizing social wel�fare. Attempts to interfere with these fundamental principles&#x2014;regulations, for example&#x2014;only create &#x201c;deadweight losses&#x201d; that reduce the total output of the economy. We live in the best of all possible worlds (or we would, if only we could get rid of those taxes and regulations), not because God would otherwise have made a different one, but because any other world would make everyone worse off.</p><h2>Tiny Rowland: A rebel tycoon</h2><p>This is an account of the life and career of the entrepreneur, Tiny Rowland, the head of Lonrho and the owner of &#34;The Observer&#34;.

Cundall expounds and comments on Judges in a clear, straightforward style, giving a good overall perspective to the book&#39;s varied contents. In the introduction he discusses the place of the book in the canon, its composition structure and date, taking into account pertinent archaeological evidence. He also discusses briefly the political, religious and moral questions raised by the book.Morris follows the same pattern for Ruth. His introduction and commentary will appeal to both specialist and general reader as he discusses the problems of the book, showing the light shed on it by recent archaeological research. In particular he brings out forcibly the book&#39;s present relevance.</p><p>Arthur E. Cundall is a lecturer in Old Testament at London Bible College."The Tyndale volumes have long been the premier shorter-length commentary series on both Testaments throughout the English-speaking world." (Craig Blomberg, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Tyndale commentaries are always useful, not least because they focus so clearly on the text of Scripture, and do not fall into the trap of paying too much attention to other commentaries and not enough to the scriptural text they are intended to expound and explain. So they retain their usefulness for preachers, Bible study leaders and for all readers of the Bible." (Peter Adam, principal, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"Within its constraints, this series includes some outstanding volumes." (D. A. Carson, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"There simply is no series of medium-length commentaries that approaches the excellence of the Tyndale commentaries." (Donald A.

Matthew Avery Sutton draws on extensive archival research to document the ways an initially obscure network of charismatic preachers and their followers reshaped American religion, at home and abroad, for over a century. Perceiving the United States as besieged by Satanic forces communism and secularism, family breakdown and government encroachment Billy Sunday, Charles Fuller, Billy Graham, and others took to the pulpit and airwaves to explain how Biblical end-times prophecy made sense of a world ravaged by global wars, genocide, and the threat of nuclear extinction. Believing Armageddon was nigh, these preachers used what little time was left to warn of the coming Antichrist, save souls, and prepare the nation for God s final judgment. By the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan and conservative Republicans appropriated evangelical ideas to create a morally infused political agenda that challenged the pragmatic tradition of governance through compromise and consensus. Following 9/11, the politics of apocalypse continued to resonate with an anxious populace seeking a roadmap through a world spinning out of control. Premillennialist evangelicals have erected mega-churches, shaped the culture wars, made and destroyed presidential hopefuls, and brought meaning to millions of believers. Narrating the story of modern evangelicalism from the perspective of the faithful, Sutton demonstrates how apocalyptic thinking continues to exert enormous influence over the American mainstream today.&#34;</p><p>"American Apocalypse" is <b>a work of impressive erudition as well as a work of beauty.</b> Arguing for the centrality in the American evangelical tradition of ideas about how the world will end, Sutton embeds the narrative in twentieth-century U.S. and international political history in a way that few American religious historians have been able to do. --Grant Wacker, author of "America's Pastor: Billy Graham and the Shaping of a Nation<p> "It is to the great credit of Matthew Avery Sutton, an American historian who has spent the past seven years thinking about the end of the world , that we now have <b> a concise, convincing and eminently readable account of the rise of the US evangelical movement</b>, from what he scribes as provocative outsiders to consummate insiders . A <b>valuable, timely and often entertaining account </b>... --<b> Sunday Times </b><br><br>Prof Sutton brings to these strange episodes of American culture a proper degree of attentiveness and patience, with only a rare glint of irony breaking through. <i>Irish Times</i> </p><p> "Sutton tells this story well. His key achievement is that he sticks to his brief, of showing that premillennialism has been central to modern Evangelicalism, and avoids narrating every aspect of the culture wars. --<i> Times Literary Supplement </i><br><br>It is a <b>fascinating study </b>of the development of the apocalyptic or pre-millenialist strand of evangelical Christianity in the United States over the last hundred years. <b>Sutton has produced one of those rare books that is both academically rigorous and a very good read. </b>The subject matter invites ridicule, but he treats it respectfully, while frequently adopting a wryly humorous tone. The book draws on very extensive research and benefits further from numerous illustrations, including rarely seen cartoons from 20th century evangelical magazines. --<b> LSE Review of Books </b></p>Matthew Avery Sutton is Edward R.

But he has the dubious fortune of the hyperactive Miles Vorkosigan as a cousin, which has too-often led to his getting dragged into one of Miles&#x2019; schemes, with risk to life and limb&#x2014;and military career&#x2014;that Ivan doesn&#x2019;t consider entirely fair. Although much practice has made Ivan more adept at fending off his mother&#x2019;s less-than-subtle reminders that he should be getting married and continuing the Vorpatril lineage.<br> <br>Fortunately, his current duty is on the planet Komarr as staff officer to Admiral Desplains, far from both his cousin and his mother back on their homeworld of Barrayar. It&#x2019;s an easy assignment and nobody is shooting at him. What could go wrong?<br> <br>Plenty, it turns out, when Byerly Vorrutyer, an undercover agent for Imperial Security, shows up on his doorstep and asks him to make the acquaintance of a young woman, recently arrived on Komarr, who seems to be in danger. That Byerly is characteristically vague about the nature of the danger, not to mention the lady&#x2019;s name, should have been Ivan&#x2019;s first clue, but Ivan is no more able to turn aside from aiding a damsel in distress than he could resist trying to rescue a kitten from a tree.<br> <br>It is but a short step down the road of good intentions to the tangle of Ivan&#x2019;s life, in trouble with the Komarran authorities, with his superiors, and with the lethal figures hunting the mysterious but lovely Tej and her exotic blue companion Rish&#x2014;a tangle to test the lengths to which Ivan will go as an inspired protector.<br> <br>But though his predicament is complicated, at least Ivan doesn&#x2019;t have to worry about hassle from family.

For years fans have clamored for Ivan Vorpatril&#x2019;s story, and at last Bujold delivers something that will both thrill the devoted audience and entrance new readers. For many years, Ivan has been perfectly content to live a quiet bachelor life and serve as a staff officer to a Barrayaran admiral. With no desire for the imperial throne or the types of death-defying adventures that his cousin Miles so adores, Ivan has become a master at avoiding political intrigue and entangling alliances. Asked to look after a young woman during a brief trip to Komarr, Ivan is happy to oblige. But when his attempt to ask the woman out ends up with her handmaiden knocking him out and tying him to a chair, Ivan realizes that something very bad is going on. It quickly becomes clear that the only way Ivan can save himself and his charge is to marry Tej Arqua and bring her home to Barrayar. Longtime readers will love seeing a new side of Ivan as well as hearing his views on many of the series characters. New readers can enjoy Ivan&#x2019;s story on its own but will miss many of the nuances that add depth and character; best to begin at the beginning.

In <i>Civilising Subjects</i>, Catherine Hall argues that the idea of empire was at the heart of mid-nineteenth-century British self-imagining, with peoples such as the "Aborigines" in Australia and the "negroes" in Jamaica serving as markers of difference separating "civilised" English from "savage" others.<br> <br> Hall uses the stories of two groups of Englishmen and -women to explore British self-constructions both in the colonies and at home. In Jamaica, a group of Baptist missionaries hoped to make African-Jamaicans into people like themselves, only to be disappointed when the project proved neither simple nor congenial to the black men and women for whom they hoped to fashion new selves. And in Birmingham, abolitionist enthusiasm dominated the city in the 1830s, but by the 1860s, a harsher racial vocabulary reflected a new perception of the nonwhite subjects of empire as different kinds of men from the "manly citizens" of Birmingham.<br> <br> This absorbing study of the "racing" of Englishness will be invaluable for imperial and cultural historians.</p></p><p><b>Catherine Hall</b> is a professor of history at University College, London.

She is the author of the Lucy Kincaid Novels, including <i>Cold Snap </i>and <i>Dead Heat</i>. A former consultant in the California State Legislature, she lives in Northern California with her husband Dan and their five children.Chapter One <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Going home was a bitch. <br>Maxine Revere had flirted with the idea of flying in solely for Kevin&#x2019;s funeral so her perfect and dysfunctional family wouldn&#x2019;t hear about her visit until she was already on a plane back to New York City. Three things stopped her. <br>Foremost, Max did not run away from uncomfortable situations. She recognized that she wasn&#x2019;t the same nineteen-year-old who&#x2019;d defied her family. <br>She&#x2019;d also get a kick from walking into the family mansion unannounced and watching a reboot of <i>Dallas,</i> set in California. The Sterling-Revere family could take on the Ewings and win without breaking a nail or going to jail. Being the blackest sheep in the herd was more fun than taking two cross-country flights in one day. <br>But the primary reason she was staying for the weekend was for Kevin&#x2019;s sister, Jodi O&#x2019;Neal. Kevin had been Max&#x2019;s former best friend and confidante. He&#x2019;d killed himself and Jodi had questions. She had no answers for the college coed, but she understood why Jodi sought truth where there had only been lies. Max had survived grief, she&#x2019;d been a close acquaintance to death, and maybe she could give Jodi a modicum of peace. <br>Traveling first class had advantages, including prompt disembarking. Max strode off the plane at San Francisco International Airport, her long legs putting distance between her and the other passengers. Her two-inch heels made her an even six feet, but her confident stride and stunning looks caused heads to turn. She ignored the attention. Her cell phone vibrated and she ignored that, too. <br>Her full-time assistant and as-needed bodyguard, former Army Ranger David Kane, easily kept up with her. He turned heads as well, mostly from fear. When he wasn&#x2019;t smiling, he looked like he&#x2019;d kill you with no remorse or pleasure. He didn&#x2019;t smile often. But as Max had learned, looks were a form of lying. David&#x2019;s steel core protected him as much as her pursuit of truth protected Max. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need you,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;We settled this yesterday, or were you placating me?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;All I suggested was that I drive you to Atherton before I head to Marin.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s foolish for you to drive an hour out of your way. I&#x2019;m not incapable of driving myself.&#x201d; She ignored David&#x2019;s subtle smirk. &#x201c;And I need a car. This isn&#x2019;t New York where I can walk everywhere or grab a taxi. <i>Go.</i> Emma is waiting.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re sure.&#x201d; <br>She glared at him. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s your daughter.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She comes with her mother.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the one who screwed Brittney in a failed attempt to prove I wasn&#x2019;t gay,&#x201d; Max said, &#x201c;and I will not let you use me as an excuse to avoid the selfish bitch.&#x201d; Tough love. David adored his twelve-year-old daughter, but her mother made their relationship difficult. Brittney wouldn&#x2019;t let David spend a minute more with Emma than the court mandated, and the flight delay had already cost him two hours. <br>They wove through the crowd at baggage claim without slowing down, and stopped at the carousel where their luggage would be delivered. <br>&#x201c;Emma wants to see you,&#x201d; David said. <br>&#x201c;The funeral is tomorrow. You&#x2019;ll be on a plane to Hawaii Sunday morning. Enjoy your vacation&#x2014;when you get back, if I&#x2019;m still here, we can meet up in the city for lunch and I&#x2019;ll take Emma shopping.&#x201d; <br>David grunted. &#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t need more clothes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;A girl can never have too many shoes.&#x201d; Max doubted she&#x2019;d have kids of her own, and she enjoyed playing aunt to David&#x2019;s daughter when Emma visited him in New York. <br>Max parked herself near the carousel opening because she didn&#x2019;t want to be here any longer than she had to. Airports were part of her life, but she grew tired of the waiting part. Before leaving Miami, she&#x2019;d shipped one of her suitcases back home to New York; the second, smaller bag of essentials she&#x2019;d brought with her to California. She didn&#x2019;t plan to stay in town long. <br>&#x201c;Ms. Revere?&#x201d; an elderly voice behind her asked. <br>Max turned and looked down at an older couple. The man, at least eighty and maybe five foot four in lifts, stood with his wife, who barely topped five feet. They both had white hair and blue eyes and would have looked like cherubs if their faces weren&#x2019;t so deeply wrinkled. <br>Max smiled politely. &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m Maxine Revere.&#x201d; She expected them to ask for autographs or question what investigation brought her to California. The true crime show she hosted every month on cable television had been moving up in the ratings. When she only wrote newspaper articles and books, few people outside of the business knew what she looked like. Now that she was on camera, people approached her regularly. <br>There were pros and cons to being recognized. She was on a tight time schedule today, but the couple looked sweet. <br>&#x201c;I told you, Henry,&#x201d; the woman said to her husband. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Penny Hoffman.&#x201d; Mrs. Hoffman extended her hand nervously. It was cold, dry, and fragile, like the woman in front of her. &#x201c;This is my husband, Henry. I knew it was you.&#x201d; She gripped her purse tightly with both hands, the straps worn and frayed. &#x201c;Do you believe in divine providence?&#x201d; <br>Touchy subject. Max answered, &#x201c;Sometimes.&#x201d; <br>David was standing to the side, watching the situation. He was always on alert, even when it was wholly unnecessary. Ever since the incident in Chicago last year when Max had been attacked in a parking garage by someone who hadn&#x2019;t wanted to hear the truth on her show, David was suspicious of everyone. <br>Even little old ladies. <br>&#x201c;We just flew in from Phoenix,&#x201d; Henry said. <br>&#x201c;For our granddaughter&#x2019;s wedding,&#x201d; Penny added. &#x201c;Last year, we were here for a funeral.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;My condolences,&#x201d; Max said. <br>Penny blinked back a sheen of tears and smiled awkwardly. &#x201c;Our other grandchild. Jessica&#x2019;s brother, Jason.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Penny,&#x201d; Henry said, taking his wife&#x2019;s hand, &#x201c;Ms. Revere doesn&#x2019;t want to hear about this now.&#x201d; <br>Penny continued. &#x201c;The police say they have no leads.&#x201d; <br>The way she said &#x201c;no leads&#x201d; had Max&#x2019;s instincts twitching. The police may have no leads they shared with the family, but there was always a lead&#x2014;and it was obvious by her tone that Penny had her own theories. <br>In Max&#x2019;s experience, murder was almost always personal. There were stranger murders and serial killers, but they were few and far between. Most victims were killed by those they trusted most. A friend. A spouse. A parent. A child. <br>David cleared his throat. He grabbed Max&#x2019;s red case from the conveyor belt. He&#x2019;d already retrieved his smaller khaki bag. He wouldn&#x2019;t have checked it at all, except he&#x2019;d packed a gun. <br>&#x201c;They need to go,&#x201d; Henry told Penny. &#x201c;It was very nice to meet you, Ms. Revere. Very nice. You&#x2019;re even prettier in person.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Max said. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d like to write me a letter about your grandson&#x2019;s case, here&#x2019;s my office address and e-mail.&#x201d; She pulled a card from her pocket. <br>She received hundreds of letters and e-mails a week from families wanting her to do any number of things, from proving a loved one innocent to a killer guilty. Most dealt with cold cases and contained few leads. She didn&#x2019;t have time to investigate all the unsolved murders she heard about, and she couldn&#x2019;t always solve the ones she investigated. <br>But she always gave the families whatever truth she found. For better or worse. <br>She took a pen out of her pocket and wrote on the back. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s my personal e-mail.&#x201d; <br>Henry took the card but Penny looked upset. &#x201c;I have written. Twice.&#x201d; <br>By the sound of her voice, she hadn&#x2019;t received a response. A sliver of anger ran up Max&#x2019;s spine. Her newest assistant was going to have some explaining to do if she wanted to keep her job. All e-mails and letters must be responded to within a week. Max had drafted four form letters that fit most situations, and what didn&#x2019;t fit she was supposed to review. <br>Henry said, &#x201c;We thought you might be interested in the case since Jason was killed at Atherton Prep.&#x201d; <br>Max was speechless&#x2014;a rarity. She&#x2019;d graduated from Atherton College Prep thirteen years ago, but no one told her about this murder. The second in the history of the campus. <br>&#x201c;When?&#x201d; she managed to ask. <br>&#x201c;The Saturday after Thanksgiving.&#x201d; <br>Nearly five months ago. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in town all weekend,&#x201d; Max said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to hear your story. I can&#x2019;t promise I&#x2019;ll investigate, but I will listen.&#x201d; <br>They both smiled and tears moistened Penny&#x2019;s eyes. Max didn&#x2019;t want to see tears. Especially genuine tears, like Penny&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Thank you. We&#x2019;ll be here for two weeks. You don&#x2019;t know what this means to us.&#x201d; <br>Max had Kevin&#x2019;s funeral tomorrow, she was meeting with Jodi in an hour&#x2014;she was going to be late&#x2014;and then there was her own family she had to deal with. That she could put off. <br>&#x201c;Where are you staying?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The Embassy Suites in Redwood Shores,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;Our son said we could stay with them, but they have so many last-minute things to do for the wedding, we didn&#x2019;t want to be a bother.&#x201d; <br>Max smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you wouldn&#x2019;t have been any trouble. I can meet you at your hotel tomorrow morning. Is eight too early?&#x201d; <br>Penny said, &#x201c;We always rise at dawn.&#x201d; <br>David was giving Max his version of the evil eye. For him, it was a sterner frown than he normally wore. <br>Max attached her laptop case to the top of her suitcase and said good-bye to the Hoffmans. She and David stepped out of the terminal and into the spring morning, a cold wind rolling off the Bay that made her shiver. It had been seventy degrees and clear when she left Miami Airport at 6:00 A.M. <br>They walked down the wide sidewalk toward the rental car shuttle stop. <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; David said. <br>She didn&#x2019;t answer his question. &#x201c;Call Ginger. Tell her to find the letters the Hoffmans mentioned and get them to me, verbatim, before she leaves the office today. I want to know why I didn&#x2019;t see them in the first place.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Maybe she thought you had enough on your plate. Or maybe she didn&#x2019;t see them at all. They could have come in when Ashley was still in the office. Or Josh.&#x201d; <br>Max didn&#x2019;t want to think about Ashley. What a train wreck. And Josh? Every time she thought about him, she wished she could fire him all over again. <br>Max didn&#x2019;t have a great track record with office managers. David had been with her for eighteen months&#x2014;in that time, she&#x2019;d gone through six office managers. So far, Ginger had been with her for three months. Two more weeks and she&#x2019;d win the prize for longest assistant. <br>They stopped under the shuttle sign. David handed Max his cell phone. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Marco.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s calling you, not me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Because you haven&#x2019;t been answering your phone. This is the third time he&#x2019;s called me.&#x201d; <br>Max didn&#x2019;t take the phone, so David answered. Max tried to ignore the conversation as she looked for any sign that the shuttle was near. It was nowhere in sight. <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s right here,&#x201d; David said. &#x201c;No, she didn&#x2019;t lose her phone.&#x201d; <br>Max swore under her breath and took David&#x2019;s phone from his hand. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t answer my phone because I didn&#x2019;t want to talk to you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You have to talk to me sometime, sweetheart.&#x201d; FBI Special Agent Marco Lopez spoke low and clear, working double-time to control his Cuban temper. <br>&#x201c;Not today.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You intentionally left before I saw the news.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I told you yesterday I had a funeral in California.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t tell me that you filed your article, and you had plenty of time to record a three-minute spot for the local news. You exposed my informant and jeopardized my case!&#x201d; His voice rose in volume as he spoke. <br>Max had a lot of experience remaining calm while talking to Marco. &#x201c;Your informant put one of his hookers in the hospital for a week and thwarted the investigation into Candace Arunda&#x2019;s murder.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He was my only link to the Garbena cartel!&#x201d; Though Marco was born and raised in Miami, his parents had both come from Cuba, and when he got angry and spoke fast, he adopted a hybrid Americanized Cuban accent. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not rehashing this with you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I told you why I was in Miami when you asked last week.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You should have warned me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Last time I gave you an early copy of an article, your boss attempted to have it scuttled.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That was nine years ago!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Fool me once,&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;Dammit, Max! You avoided me because you <i>know</i> you overstepped this time.&#x201d; She pictured Marco pacing his office, his free hand opening and closing. <br>&#x201c; <i>Overstepped?</i>&#x201d; Max took a deep breath. Marco, more than anyone, could raise her blood pressure. &#x201c;Is that what you call exposing the truth about the brutal murder of an underage prostitute? Is an &#x2018;in&#x2019; with the cartel more important than justice for a seventeen-year-old girl?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t twist what I said! You know I care. You should have given me twenty-four hours to clean up this mess. Ramirez would have been in prison either way.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your team screwed up, another girl was in jeopardy, and I&#x2019;m supposed to give you time to fix it because we&#x2019;re having sex? Garbena is costing you your soul, Marco.&#x201d; <br>David cleared his throat. Maxine didn&#x2019;t care about attracting an audience as much as her assistant, but she stepped farther away from the other travelers waiting for the shuttle. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the most frustrating woman I&#x2019;ve ever known!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never lied to you, Marco. I wish you could say the same to me.&#x201d; She hung up and returned David&#x2019;s phone. <br>Her stomach was twisted in knots. She wished she could have left things differently with Marco. <br>&#x201c;You should have told him before you left,&#x201d; David said. <br>&#x201c;He knew why I was in Miami, and he lied to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He couldn&#x2019;t tell you&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>Max rarely interrupted, but she didn&#x2019;t let David finish. &#x201c;He <i>lied.</i> He didn&#x2019;t say, &#x2018;Max, I can&#x2019;t talk to you about this case,&#x2019; which he&#x2019;s done in the past and I accept. This time, he deliberately gave me false information to protect his criminal informant, and then he expected me to put it in print. You know as well as I do that Marco and his team want the big fish, and if innocent guppies get eaten in the process, it&#x2019;s collateral damage.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You still should have told him. He shouldn&#x2019;t have read it in the morning paper.&#x201d; He glanced at her, understanding narrowing his eyes. &#x201c;You intentionally sabotaged your relationship. Why?&#x201d; <br>She didn&#x2019;t answer right away because the shuttle pulled up. There were five of them, and Max sat in the back row of the twelve-passenger van. David sat next to her. Maybe because of David&#x2019;s appearance, or her previous phone conversation, the other passengers crammed into the front. <br>David was perceptive. She may not have consciously wanted to end her mostly off relationship with Special Agent Marco Lopez, but it was primarily physical. They had a long history. But she couldn&#x2019;t allow her libido to control her career. She never had in the past, and just because she had feelings for Marco didn&#x2019;t mean she&#x2019;d allow it to happen now. <br>&#x201c;In the nine years I&#x2019;ve known Marco I&#x2019;ve never lied to him,&#x201d; Max said after the van started moving. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never told him I was someone I&#x2019;m not. He thinks he can change me, and every time I see him we screw like rabbits and he tries to get me to bury my story. When I don&#x2019;t, he accuses me of not caring who I hurt. I&#x2019;m tired of explaining myself to him, and I&#x2019;m not going to change just to please him.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I give you six months.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;To find a story to cover in Miami so you have an excuse to go back.&#x201d; <br>Max laughed, a deep throaty genuine laugh. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I love you, David. You remind me that I am flawed.&#x201d; <br>He smiled, which made the two-inch jagged scar across his left temple almost charming. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the least I can do.&#x201d; <br>The shuttle van pulled up in front of the rental car kiosks. David had previously taken care of the arrangements and handed her the paperwork.

Original.</p><p>New York Times bestselling author G. A. Aiken lives on the West Coast and is the creator of the Dragon Kin series. When she&#39;s not writing about sexy dragons, she&#39;s writing about sexy wolves, lions, tigers, and other fang-filled predators under the name Shelly Laurenston. Visit her at gaaiken.com.Briec has battled dragons and men and wooed&nbsp;women. A dragon couldn&#x2019;t have a better life,&nbsp;but his brother&#x2019;s recent mating makes him wonder if maybe there&#x2019;s a bit more to be had. A brief encounter with a peasant woman, Talaith, convinces him that she should be the one. But Talaith has more pressing issues than entertaining a dragon, no matter how alluring: danger looms&nbsp;on the horizon, and she may be the only one to stop it. The second installment in Aiken&#x2019;s trilogy (Dragon Actually, 2008) follows in the quirky, humorous tradition of Xena, offering a welcome high fantasy with modern sensibilities. Briec really is an arrogant son-of-a-dragon, and more amusing and lovable for it. He and Talaith walk the well-worn path of the bickering sweethearts who seem to love best when at their worst, and Aiken&#x2019;s use of crude&nbsp;references in&nbsp;sex scenes may&nbsp;violate&nbsp;reader comfort zones, but this tale should definitely please fans of sexy shape-shifters and epic sagas. --Nina C.

This title provides practical synthesis of the cognitive sciences. Drawing heavily on psychology, neuroscience, sociology, and linguistics, Zaltman combines academic rigor with real-world results to offer highly accessible insights, based on his years of research and consulting work with large clients like Coca-Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble. An all-new tool kit: Zaltman provides research tools - metaphor elicitation, response latency, and implicit association techniques, to name a few - that will be all-new to marketers and demonstrates how innovators can use these tools to get clues from the subconscious when developing new products and finding new solutions, long before competitors do.</p><p>Jerry Zaltman is a Professor of Marketing at Harvard Business School and a fellow at Harvard University&#39;s interdisciplinary Mind, Brain, Behavior Initiative.Harvard Business School professor Zaltman notes that despite enormous amounts of time and money dedicated to customer surveys and marketing, approximately 80% of all new products fail within six months or fall significantly short of their profit forecast. This shouldn't be surprising, he convincingly argues, since "a great mismatch exists between the way consumers experience and think about their world and the methods marketers use to collect this information." He calls for creative questioning that probes the unconscious values underlying consumers' reactions to products and marketing campaigns. Drawing on an impressive array of recent multidisciplinary research, Zaltman is especially provocative on the importance of memory, metaphor and storytelling in customers' decision making and the ways marketers might use these findings. Marketers worried about the scale and complexity of the surveys Zaltman advocates will breathe a sigh of relief as he outlines efficient methods to develop a set of shared values in a target market by creatively interviewing a small sample of customers. In fact, large vision and practical application go hand-in-hand for Zaltman. He may caution, rather abstractly, that successfully gauging the mind of the market depends on developing creative surveys and quality thinking about information gathered, but he also reminds readers to frame campaigns for a product in terms that vividly communicate its function and its emotional appeal for consumers. Zaltman's smart, practical analysis and many success stories will hold special appeal for those facing competitive markets, as well as for those rethinking more limited marketing approaches. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Xenophon: Memorabilia. Oeconomicus. Symposium. Apologia. (Loeb Classical Library No. 168)</h2><p>In <i>Memorabilia</i> or <i>Memoirs of Socrates</i> and in <i>Oeconomicus</i>, a dialogue about household management, we see the philosopher through Xenophon's eyes. Here, and in the accompanying <i>Symposium</i> we also obtain insight on life in Athens. The volume concludes with Xenophon's <i>Apology</i>, an interesting complement to Plato's account of Socrates' defense at his trial. Ostensibly an account of a dinner party in the summer of 421 BCE, Xenophon's <i>Symposium</i> is a vibrant picture of an Athenian evening of quiet entertainment and conversation. Among the guests Socrates is the central figure, and&#x2014;as in Plato's <i>Symposium</i>&#x2014;love is the main subject of debate. But the style here is more relaxed and less artful than in Plato's philosophical dialogue, yielding an engaging portrait of Socrates and of Athenian social life.</p><p></p><h2>Spirit: Garden Inspiration</h2><p>Taking inspiration from art, sculpture, Chicago prairies and folk architecture such as tree houses, Dan Pearson--acclaimed garden designer and "green-fingered guru" at the U.K. newspaper <i>The Observer</i>--lays out his design philosophy and working process, giving readers direct insight into his collaborative approach of working with nature, instead of imposing preconceptions upon it. Journeying from New Zealand to Japan via Thames-side barge gardens, Pearson focuses on the spirit of place as it emerges through geography, history, architecture and native flora, extrapolating this sense of place into a new gardening philosophy. Very far from conventional gardening books, <i>Spirit</i> radically expands the genre, inviting us to understand the act of gardening in the light of contemporary needs and with a keen environmental awareness; Pearson particularly stresses the importance of skills such as being able to "read" a variety of landscapes (both wild and cultivated), and of staying open to what those landscapes suggest in terms of cultivation. This long-awaited paperback edition uses 400 of Pearson's own much-admired photographs as reference points.<br><b>Dan Pearson</b> began his career as a professional designer in 1987. He is co-author of <i>The Essential Garden Book</i> (with Sir Terence Conran) and author of <i>The Garden: A Year at Home Farm</i>.

Griffin's third installment in the Honor Bound series. <i>Secret Honor</i> is an intricate book that reveals a remarkable attentiveness to historical detail and characterization. It is also a top-notch thriller set in Griffin's quasi-fictional version of WWII.<p> The plot is woven with so many threads, all of them worthwhile, that it actually feels more like a chronicle than a novel, but the central story takes up the continuing adventures of OSS agent Cletus Frade. Frade, a U.S. Marine whose father was almost the president of Argentina, was raised in Texas and now uses his father's special status in Argentine society to penetrate Nazi plans for South America. This time, however, Frade is not so much fighting the Nazis as supporting them. While one group, Himmler among them, is secretly stashing funds in Argentina to prepare for an escape when the Reich finally crumbles, a second group, including a German general and his son, are actually plotting to assassinate Hitler. Meanwhile, the OSS is on the verge of ex-communicating Frade, given his unwillingness to reveal the identity of the son, code-named "Galahad." </p><p> The details are what make this book: Cletus Frade is imprinted on the mind, clad in grease-stained khaki trousers, spouting Spanish-Texan four-letter epithets, and sporting cowboy boots as he repairs his father's ravaged old Horch touring sedan at Estancia San Pedro y San Pablo. Particularly engaging is Griffin's account of Argentine upper-strata social "politics," as Father Welner steers Cletus into his inevitable marriage. Reading <i>Secret Honor</i>, one enters many vividly drawn places--from Nazi secret meetings to Argentine estates--that bring this pivotal era to life. Finishing the book leaves one feeling a rare combination of sadness in leaving close colleagues behind and exhilaration at having witnessed history being made. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>W.E.B. Griffin is the author of six bestselling series.</p><h2>Mao: A Life</h2><p>The definitive biography of the man who dominated modern Chinese history.<br><br>When the Nationalists routed a ragtag Red Army on the Xiang River during the Long March, an earthy Chinese peasant with a brilliant mind moved to a position of power. Eight years after his military success, Mao Tse-Tung had won out over more sophisticated rivals to become party chairman, his title for life. Isolated by his eminence, he lived like a feudal emperor for much of his reign after a blood purge took more lives than those killed by either Stalin or Hitler. His virtual quarantine resulted in an ideological/political divide and a devastating reign of terror that became the Cultural Revolution. Though Mao broke the shackles of two thousand years of Confucian right thinking and was the major force of contemporary China, he reverted to the simplistic thinking of his peasant origins at the , sustained by the same autocratic process that supported China's first emperors.<br><br>One cannot understand today's China without first understanding Mao. Attempts to view Mao's life through Western lenses inevitably present a cartoonish monster or hero, both far removed from the real man. Philip Short's masterly assessment-informed by secret documents recently found in China-allows the reader to understand this colossal figure whose shadow will dominate the twenty-first century.<br></p><p>Of the three great tyrants of the 20th century--Hitler, Stalin, and Mao--the West generally knows the least about the latter. What we do know is that he was every bit as genocidal in his policies as either of the other two great villains of the age. In fact, in purely statistical terms, Mao might have been responsible for the deaths of more people than Hitler and Stalin combined. However, Philip Short's immense but immensely readable and impressively researched biography of the man goes far deeper than this. Yes, he acknowledges, Mao was a tyrant, but then China always has been run by tyrants; it never has had a tradition of democracy. And Mao was also an idealist: the deaths of millions was, as he saw it, the price that his country had to pay for being dragged from a state of medieval servitude--perpetually on the brink of famine--to that of a modern, industrialized, self-sufficient nation, in the space of a single lifetime. Short also humanizes Mao, and shows a man who had a profound and sincere interest in Chinese philosophy and poetry, and a surprisingly sharp sense of humor. None of this can exonerate Mao from the charge of inhumanity on an epic scale. But it does make for a much more rounded and complex portrait of the figure who, as the 21st century unfolds, might be shown to have had more influence on world history than either Hitler or Stalin. <i>--Christopher Hart, Amazon.co.uk</i>Philip Short has been a foreign correspondent for The London Times, The Economist, and BBC in Uganda, Moscow, China, and Washington.

The savage and hilarious analysis of America&#39;s funeral practices rocked the industry and shocked the public. This up-dated edition (revised just before the author&#39;s death) shows that if anything the industry has become more pernicious than ever in its assault on our practices and wallets. And it&#39;s an industry that - alas - sooner or later affects us all.</p><p><i>The American Way of Death Revisited</i> is almost unforgivably funny. Jessica Mitford's expos� of the funeral industry, a number one bestseller upon first publication, is a model of muckraking--an almost incredible description of how undertakers in the U.S. assault people's souls and wallets. Before her death in 1996, Mitford devoted most of her energy to this revised edition of her masterwork, which zeroes in on funeral prepayment (the chapter is titled "Pay Now--Die Poorer"), the new multinational funeral corporations ("A Global Village of the Dead"), and the Federal Trade Commission's failure to enforce the laws the first edition of this book helped bring about. The book's greatest treasure is probably her shocking and hilarious description of exactly what happens in the process of embalming. Equally impressive, however, is her chapter called "The Nosy Clergy," which describes the collusion and competition between America's undertakers and its preachers. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>classic anatomy of America's funeral practices, revised, expanded, and brought up-to-date for a new generation.<br><br>Thirty-five years ago, Jessica Mitford's savage and hilarious <b>The American Way of Death</b> was a number one best-seller and occasioned new legislation intended to reform the funeral industry. By the time of her death in 1996, Mitford had almost finished a complete revision of that long-out-of-print book--demonstrating, with her genius for outrageous and devastating muckraking, that, far from being reformed, the industry is more pernicious than ever in its assault on our values and our wallets. <br><br>This revised edition contains completely new chapters on, among other things, prepayment ("Pay Now--Die Poorer") and the new multi-national corporations ("A Global Village of the Dead"), as well as a jaundiced look at the failure of the Federal Trade Commission to enforce the laws that the original edition of this book helped bring about.

But she hid a secret life. She was a prescription drug addict. She was also a &#x201c;doctor shopper&#x201d; who manipulated Upper East Side psychiatrists for pills, pills, and more pills; a lonely bulimic who spent hundreds of dollars a week on binge foods; a promiscuous party girl who danced barefoot on banquets; a weepy and hallucination-prone insomniac who would take anything&#x2014;<i>anything</i>&#x2014;to sleep.<br> <br>This is a tale of self-loathing, self-sabotage, and yes, self-tanner. It begins at a posh New England prep school&#x2014;and with a prescription for Attention Deficit Disorder medication Ritalin.

To me, being a beauty editor was better than being president of the United States! Yes, I lifted these lines directly from the opening of the movie Goodfellas and replaced &#x201c;gangster&#x201d; with &#x201c;beauty editor.&#x201d; But they work here, in my story, too.<br> <br>In front of me are two very rare back issues of Beauty Queen Magazine, the hottest title of the nineties. Full of brassy Magic Marker blondes with ballpoint pen&#x2013;red lips and crudely drawn noses that look like dicks, the mag featured &#x201c;the most beautiful ladies age 10&#x2013;20&#x201d; in the latest fashions: wedding dresses, bikinis, and what appears to be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. snorkeling gear. As for beauty, the &#x201c;Feb&#x2013;June 1991&#x201d; issue&#x2019;s cover girl, Lindsay Liner, is &#x201c;[a]dvertising New Michanne Make-Up&#x201d;&#x2014;and we know this because there&#x2019;s an arrow drawn from the credit, pointing directly at Ms. Liner&#x2019;s face. Alternately, the &#x201c;July&#x2013;Sept 1991&#x201d; cover model is sans fard: &#x201c;Sally Smothers, an all-natrural [sic] girl without make-up!&#x201d; the cover line reads. &#x201c;Does she look right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But Cat, who published this dope magazine?&#x201d; all you print aficionados must be wondering. &#x201c;Hearst? Hachette? Meredith Corp.?&#x201d; No, no, and (definitely) no. I published Beauty Queen Magazine. I launched it in 1990, at seven years old. Young Caitlin Marnell was also editor in chief, art director .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. everything! If you were a blood relative, you subscribed to my magazine whether you fucking liked it or no: that was my readership. Which explains why there are still so many back issues floating around a quarter of a century later.<br> <br>I hadn&#x2019;t seen a copy of Beauty Queen Magazine for fifteen years when I discovered the two issues in 2010 in one of my grandmother Mimi&#x2019;s keepsake drawers. I was gobsmacked as I paged through them. Had I really been tuned in to like things like advertiser relationships and beauty credits and &#x201c;makeunder&#x201d; stories and cover lines when I was in third grade? The evidence was right there in my hands. I&#x2019;d been &#x201c;playing&#x201d; beauty editor almost twenty years before I actually became one.<br> <br>Crazy, right?! But then again, I guess that&#x2019;s just how it is when you&#x2019;re hardwired to do something&#x2014;to be something. And I&#x2019;m sure of it: I was born hardwired to be a beauty editor. The thing is, I was also born hardwired for addiction&#x2014;I believe so, anyway&#x2014;and this has caused some .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. problems.<br> <br>But I&#x2019;m getting way ahead of myself. Let&#x2019;s turn back time, shall we?<br> <br>Warning! If you are grossed out by &#x201c;white girl privilege&#x201d; (who isn&#x2019;t?), you might want to bail now. I am from the same town as disgraced former E! network personality Giuliana Rancic&#x2014;Bethesda, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, DC, so white that you could practically snort it like a line&#x2014;and there&#x2019;s nothing I can do about that. Believe me, I have tried to cut this chapter out twice! My editor keeps making me put it back in. Also, I get very bored talking about my childhood, which means you might get very bored reading about it. Let&#x2019;s just get it over with.<br> <br>I was born on September 10, 1982, in the District of Columbia under a crack-rock white moon (Marion &#x201c;bitch set me up&#x201d; Barry was mayor, after all). I&#x2019;ve got a cassette tape recording of my birth and everything. A sample:<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a girl!&#x201d; the doctor announces.<br> <br>&#x201c;A girl?&#x201d; my mother wails. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want a girl!&#x201d; Aw.<br> <br>When I was a kid, I had it all and then some. I grew up in a swanky neighborhood that was about &#x201c;twenty minutes from the White House,&#x201d; as my parents always said. The houses on my street, Kachina Lane, were so far apart that no one ever had any trick-or-treaters on Halloween. Our next-door neighbor was a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist who&#x2019;d uncovered a CIA plot to assassinate Fidel Castro. He was Mormon and had about a zillion blond grandchildren and a huge, kooky storybook-�looking Tudor house with a &#x201c;bee problem&#x201d; in the walls. This meant there was a crack over the living room sofa that oozed honey, and you could swipe the trickle and then pop your finger into your mouth. Mmm.<br> <br>On the other side of our property was the white-clapboard Hermon Presbyterian Church. I played hide-and-seek in the pretty little cemetery with my chocolate lab, Benny the Bear. Then there were some woods, and then&#x2014;two minutes down the road&#x2014;there was a cream-�colored mansion at 8313 Permission Tree Road. When I was about thirteen, someone put up iron gates with a cursive T on them. Then the boxer Mike Tyson moved in! He&#x2019;d just gotten out of jail for rape. My sister and brother&#x2014;Emily and Phil&#x2014;and I would wave at his white limo. Sometimes we saw him grocery shopping at the Giant Foods in Potomac Village.<br> <br>What did the Pulitzer Prize winner, Mike Tyson, and the Marnell family have in common? Our properties had backyards adjacent to the famous Congressional Country Club golf course.<br> <br>&#x201c;FORE!&#x201d; we&#x2019;d scream, right as a senator/golfer type was trying to focus on a crucial putt. Our backyard trampoline was practically on top of one of the holes.<br> <br>When tournaments like the US Open came through, my sister and I sold soda cans and water bottles through the fence for a dollar a pop. We broke into the course in the summer to run around in the sprinklers; I was also always uprooting the strange mini&#x2013;Capitol Building domes that were all over the place and smuggling them back to my yard. In the winter, we&#x2019;d go sledding in Congressional, which wasn&#x2019;t that great. You know how golf courses are! They aren&#x2019;t made for children or real fun. You&#x2019;d slide down a not-so-steep man-made incline and then&#x2014;whoop&#x2014;drop another foot into a sand trap. So that was as good as the sledding got.<br> <br>Our front yard was sprawling and green-green-green, just like the golf course. Strangers used to picnic out there; my parents let them. We had a tennis court, and a Waldorf School&#x2013;looking playground that was carved out of trees that had fallen during thunderstorms. We used the dogwood trees as soccer goals, and there were long swings hanging down from the branches of our tulip poplars. Bean pods and little pieces of fairylike fluff were always flittering down from the mimosa trees; we had a bunch of magnolia trees, too, and they had dark leaves and ultrafragrant white flowers. I used to climb them and spy on all the birds&#x2019; nests. The azalea bushes bloomed sunset colors every spring: pink, orange, orangey-red, and lavender. And there were camellia bushes, too.<br> <br>Seriously, it was insane. One time a woman even knocked on our front door and said that she was sorry if she seemed crazy, but ever since she was a little girl she&#x2019;d dreamt of getting married at 7800 Kachina Lane&#x2014;and now she was engaged! She showed us her diamond ring and everything. My parents wound up letting her have the wedding in the backyard, by the swimming pool and the rose garden. We all got to go! I hit the dance floor in a honeysuckle crown.<br> <br>My brother, sister, and I were beyond lucky to live in this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Shangri-la for ten years. My father&#x2014;not so much. Five acres is a lot to keep up with. And my dad insisted on doing the lawns himself, like he was a farmer instead of a psychiatrist. There was this cranky old red tractor that came with the property, and when we were small we always had to get on there with him&#x2014;I guess to share in his misery. I mean, I can&#x2019;t remember volunteering to get on this tractor. It just jostled you violently in the seat. It was always spitting fire balls at my dad and breaking down. He cursed at it a lot. My grandmother wanted to buy us a llama to eat the lawn, but my dad said no. He thought Mimi was a birdbrain.<br> <br>Then there was the house itself! God, it was so cool and good-�looking&#x2014;supercontemporary. Like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you know how Brad Pitt sort of thinks he&#x2019;s an architect? Brad Pitt would have loved this house. Mimi and my parents bought it from a movie producer in 1987, a few months before my fifth birthday. The story was that the legendary Frank Lloyd Wright designed it originally, but he wound up clashing with the producer&#x2019;s wife and abandoned the project to one of his students, who finished it. God knows if any of that&#x2019;s true. Either way, the place was sick. It was the skinniest house you&#x2019;ve ever seen. From the front, it looked like a military bunker&#x2014;long and one-story, with kooky rows of tiny square windows. From above, it looked like a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a pinwheel, okay? Like, there was a wand&#x2014;that was the bedrooms and the den and the hall&#x2014;and the roof was flat and covered in gravel. You could climb a Japanese maple tree to get up there, and then walk around and bang on the skylights and scare your nanny. And the head of the pinwheel was made up of the kitchen, the dining room, and the living room, which were wrapped around a huge stone chimney in the middle. You could run through all three spaces on a loop.<br> <br>The front doors were oversize and three inches thick&#x2014;dark oak, engraved. The wind always blasted them open, and my dad would lose it over the heat or AC that leaked out. The place cost a fortune in utilities every month. This was also because there were hardly any real walls. Everything was glass! When I was five, a massive tree fell through the glass living room during a summer storm. It was very Robert Frost: &#x201c;Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away / You&#x2019;d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.&#x201d; Do you know that poem? &#x201c;Birches.&#x201d; My dad quoted it all the time. Another day a little girl was over, running in and out of the house, playing tag with her brother and Phil. Then, SMASH! She ran right through one of the glass walls, and it shattered all over her. The blood gushed out of her in sheets! I saw the whole thing. It looked like the movie Carrie; she screamed and screamed. An ambulance came to take her to the hospital.<br> <br>Oh, it was such a special house. Surely I have not done it justice with my descriptions. I wish you could look it up on StreetEasy or somewhere, but you can&#x2019;t. When I was fifteen, my parents sold the house to a synagogue. I think they kept the stone chimney, but that&#x2019;s it. The magnificent front yard is now a very ugly parking lot. I mean, no offense to Adat Shalom or anything&#x2014;but it is exceptionally unsightly. Then again, I guess anything would look awful compared to the beautiful memories in my mind.<br> <br>I will now give you what you bought this book for: juicy gossip about my fascinating parents! I&#x2019;ll get right to it.<br> <br>My mom had a scale and it said: THINNER&#x2014;like the Stephen King movie. Everything about my mother was skinny&#x2014;even her nickname for me: &#x201c;Bones.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do these come in seven narrow?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d ask at the weird Italian shoe store at the Tysons II mall.<br> <br>My dad gave my mom Shalimar perfume for Christmas, but she refused to wear it. She returned the furs and jewelry he bought her, too. All she wanted was furniture, furniture, furniture. It was all bizarre and ultramodern&#x2014;to match the insane house. Her side tables looked like bicycle pumps and her living room chairs seemed like they were imported from Guant�namo Bay. Her &#x201c;pieces&#x201d; were always shattering or poking you with a sharp corner if you bumped into them. There were no throw pillows or curtains or dust ruffles or anything feminine. Everything was angular. The only thing in the whole house with any curves was the baby grand piano.<br> <br>My parents&#x2019; master suite had a glass wall overlooking the cherry blossom grove and the forsythia bushes in the backyard, and a white-and-gold tub with Jacuzzi jets that never worked. That&#x2019;s where the nannies would comb out my lice while I cried in my bathing suit. My mom smoked exactly two cigarettes every morning back there, but she said she didn&#x2019;t. She kept the gold soft packs of Benson &amp; Hedges in her underwear drawer alongside her flesh-toned bras and bikini panties. They matched her peachy-nude manicures that elongated her fingers, her neutral lipstick, her beige bob, and her tanned, toned arms.<br> <br>My mother had diabetes, so we always had a live-in nanny.<br> <br>&#x201c;My blood sugar is low,&#x201d; my mom would say when my sister and I had one of our knock-down fights. Then she&#x2019;d go back down the very long, skinny hall to her bedroom and shut the door.<br> <br>When I was in nursery school, the nannies were named things like Anka, Margaret, and Anna. Then the Berlin Wall came down, and I guess all the Eastern European girls went home. After that, our nannies were from Iowa: Ruth, Debbie, Karen, and Amy. They got us ready for school while my mom sat with her coffee and her insulin, watching Katie Couric and her gleamy crisscrossed legs on the Today show. My mom never flinched when she pricked her finger. Her diabetes drawer was full of syringes. One time I injected water into my belly. The needle didn&#x2019;t hurt at all.<br> <br>Mimi raised my mom in Virginia Beach. My mom&#x2019;s father loved golf so much that the Princess Anne Country Club flew their flag at half-mast when he died. My mom went to Norfolk Academy, then she boarded at St. Catherine&#x2019;s in Richmond. In college, she became anorexic. She kept a package of raw hot dogs chilled on her dorm room windowsill, and she ate one per day. She&#x2019;d stopped coming out of her room, but it took the college a while to realize it. Then my mom was in the hospital for a long time. I got all this dirt from Mimi. My mother didn&#x2019;t talk about it.<br> <br>And now she was a psychotherapist with a private practice on Forty-�Second Street NW and a part-time job at the Psychiatric Institute of Washington (PIW) on Wisconsin Avenue. She wasn&#x2019;t home much. Sometimes she took me to Saks Fifth Avenue in Chevy Chase to see a handbag she was &#x201c;thinking about.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, Stacey,&#x201d; the saleslady always said.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is my friend Jennifer,&#x201d; my mom would tell me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, sweetie,&#x201d; Saleslady Jennifer would coo. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard so much about you.&#x201d;<br> <br>My mom shopped and shopped and shopped. She would stay at the malls until they closed. Sometimes kids got to go. One night we came home at eight thirty&#x2014;a half hour past family dinner time. We&#x2019;d picked up takeout from California Pizza Kitchen. My brother and I carried the bags of food from the car into the dark dining room. Phil hit the switch for the chandelier, and that&#x2019;s when we saw it: all six chairs were in pieces all over the floor. The mahogany table was splintered. It looked like a tornado had come in! My mother had just bought them, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom!&#x201d; I yowled.<br> <br>She came up behind me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kids,&#x201d; she said. Her expression was as smooth as a stone in our Japanese rock garden. &#x201c;Go to your rooms.&#x201d;<br> <br>On my way downstairs, I saw that the potted tree in the foyer had been knocked over. A picture was off the wall. Someone&#x2014;I knew who&#x2014;had smashed absolutely everything. No one ever explained why.<br> <br>My dad was the chief of psychiatry at a big hospital and oversaw the adolescent unit at another. He made Washingtonian magazine&#x2019;s &#x201c;Best Doctors&#x201d; issue every year, but he told me it wasn&#x2019;t a real award.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you are homicidal or suicidal, please hang up and call 9-1-1,&#x201d; my dad&#x2019;s secretary chirped on his voice mail. &#x201c;Otherwise, leave a message.&#x201d;<br> <br>My dad&#x2019;s patients were always throwing urine on him, and things like that. Scratching him up or biting him, and he&#x2019;d have to take AIDS tests. Hanging themselves. It was a lot to deal with. He left the house at 6:45 a.m. sharp and came home hungry at 7:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. After dinner, he&#x2019;d be in his office for another hour. On Saturdays, he did a half day of rounds at the hospital. Sunday was his day off. But that&#x2019;s when he&#x2019;d get on the tractor.<br> <br>My dad loved...</p><h2>Gaining Favor with God and Man by William M. Thayer (1989) Hardcover</h2><p>By William M.

Author Rich (president of one of four MacDonald/Eddy fan clubs still extant in the US) reveals more about the two lovers than even the most avid fan might want to know, including Nelson's descriptions of Jeanette's ``little nighties.'' The question it leaves unanswered is how the feisty soprano and the lusty baritone, certainly among Hollywood's most popular stars during the late 1930s and early '40s, managed to make such goulash of their love affair. Although both singers regularly denied it, according to Rich, they were attracted to each other from the moment they met. MacDonald was characterized as ``an ambitious career gal with a bad reputation'' and was rumored to be one of Louis B. Mayer's couch tomatoes. Mayer, in fact, frowned on the singers' relationship for professional as well as personal reasons, but cast them in Naughty Marietta, their first film together. It made the duet stars--and brought them to bed after nearly a year of stolen kisses. It wasn't romantic. In a jealous rage, Nelson raped Jeanette, according to Rich. But she forgave him, beginning a cycle of reconciliation and rejection that went on for 30 years, and included suicide attempts and miscarriages. In a rejection phase, MacDonald married actor Gene Raymond (who, she discovered, preferred men as sexual partners) while Eddy wed a possessive woman who refused divorce, in spite of his numerous infidelities (MacDonald was not the only liaison). A source for much of the material, including intimate details of the couples' private meetings, is Eddy's mother, Isabel, via her son's diaries and letters. A filmography is included. A bonanza for MacDonald/Eddy fans, a pan full of nuggets for aficionados of Hollywood and MGM, but an encyclopedic struggle for the less dedicated.

All rights reserved.</i>At the height of their fame, MGM musical stars Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald spawned imitators at every Hollywood studio and became--as they remained--pop-cultural icons. The fact that they had a hush-hush, star-crossed romance going on at the time of their greatest visibility is perhaps one of Hollywood's least well-kept secrets. Rich examines that relationship and the intertwined personal and professional lives of the great screen duo exhaustively and, as she does, also brings to life an incredible supporting cast of stars, moguls, and flacks from Hollywood's golden years. Viewed from the vantage of 50-plus years, the Eddy-MacDonald movies may seem like quaint period pieces, but there is nothing quaint about the singer-actors' tangled lives and the behind-the-scenes scheming of Eddy's chief tormenter, the reptilian but always entertaining Louis B. Mayer. Rich affords a long, exciting, revealing look at two of the most important screen personalities of the 1930s. Vital reading to anyone interested in film history, Hollywood, or popular culture. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>There Really Was a Hollywood</h2><p>The noted actress offers a candid, behind-the-scenes look at Hollywood life and the workings of the film industry and reminisces about her own career, her family and colleagues, and her personal life</p><p></p><h2>Warships of the Napoleonic Era: Design, Development and Deployment</h2><p>Between 1793 and 1815 two decades of unrelenting naval warfare raised the sailing man of war to the zenith of its effectiveness as a weapon of war.

Bush and His Corporate Pals Are Plundering the Country and Hijacking Our Democracy</h2><p><p>In this powerful indictment of George W. Bush's White House, environmental attorney Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., charges that the administration has taken corporate favoritism to unprecedented heights -- threatening our health, our national security, and our democracy.</p> <p>Kennedy lifts the veil on how the administration, in order to enrich its corporate paymasters, has eviscerated the laws that protect our nation's air, water, public lands, and wildlife. He describes the White House doling out lavish subsidies and tax breaks to energy barons while allowing the corporations to profit by poisoning the public and eliminating security at the more than 15,000 nuclear and chemical facilities that are prime targets for terrorist attacks. He shows how right-wing White House ideologues have taken the "conserve" out of conservatism and trampled the free-market democracy in favor of a kind of corporate-crony capitalism that is as antithetical to democracy, efficiency, and prosperity in America as it is in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>Crimes Against Nature</b> is a book for both Democrats and Republicans, people like the traditionally conservative farmers and fishermen whom Kennedy represents in lawsuits against polluters. "Without exception," he writes, "these people see the current administration as the greatest threat not just to their livelihoods but to their values, their sense of community, and their idea of what it means to be American."</p></p><p><p>Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, chief prosecuting attorney for Riverkeeper, and president of Waterkeeper Alliance. He is also a clinical professor and supervising attorney at the Environmental Litigation Clinic at Pace University School of Law. A former assistant district attorney for New York City, he is the coauthor of <em>The Riverkeepers: Two Activists Fight to Reclaim Our Environment as a Basic Human Right</em>.</p>"Of all the debates in the scientific arena... there is none in which the White House has cooked the books more than that of global warming," argues Kennedy in this harsh indictment of what he sees as the Bush administration&#x2019;s assault on the environment and democracy in general. Kennedy&#x2019;s investigation focuses on the undue influence of industry lobbyists (read Halliburton) on environmental standards and the government&#x2019;s alleged suppression of nearly a dozen scientific reports on global warming. He maligns Bush appointees like Interior Secretary Gale Norton ("a champion of corporate welfare for three decades") and offers a cogent analysis of Christine Todd Whitman&#x2019;s departure from the EPA in 2002. Although Kennedy accuses the Bush administration of using a campaign strategy that revolves around "fear-mongering," he uses fear to drive home his own points, noting things like the lethal mercury levels in tuna, pork industry pollution and insufficiently guarded chemical plants. Nevertheless, he competently ties the survival of democracy to sound environmental policy, contending that corporate power&#x2014;particularly the power wielded by the oil, beef and lumber industries&#x2014;must never supersede democratic institutions. Kennedy&#x2019;s argument is strongest when he sticks to the facts and avoids making the kind of angry, sweeping statements that fill the concluding chapter ("Instead of can-do American ingenuity, this is the administration of "can&#x2019;t do." It has constructed a philosophy of government based on self-interest run riot: It has borrowed $9 trillion from our children and looted our Treasury..."). Whether or not one agrees with these accusations, Kennedy makes a passionate case for more effective environmental controls and wraps it up with a practical vision of a free-market future "in which businesses pay all the costs of bringing their products to market," including the costs of environmental safeguards. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(The New York Times)</p></p><p>At an Esalen Institute meeting in 1976, tai chi master Al Huang said that the Chinese word for physics is <i>Wu Li</i>, "patterns of organic energy." Journalist Gary Zukav and the others present developed the idea of physics as the dance of the Wu Li Masters--the teachers of physical essence. Zukav explains the concept further:<p> </p><blockquote> The Wu Li Master dances with his student. The Wu Li Master does not teach, but the student learns. The Wu Li Master always begins at the center, the heart of the matter.... This book deals not with knowledge, which is always past tense anyway, but with imagination, which is physics come alive, which is Wu Li.... Most people believe that physicists are explaining the world. Some physicists even believe that, but the Wu Li Masters know that they are only dancing with it. </blockquote><p> The "new physics" of Zukav's 1979 book comprises quantum theory, particle physics, and relativity. Even as these theories age they haven't percolated all that far into the collective consciousness; they're too far removed from mundane human experience not to need introduction. <i>The Dancing Wu Li Masters</i> remains an engaging, accessible way to meet the most profound and mind-altering insights of 20th-century science. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Predator</h2><p>While on a rescue mission for the CIA, the members of an elite paramilitary team are killed, one by one, by an unseen enemy in the jungles of Central America</p><p></p><h2>Out of Many: A History of the American People</h2><p>Brand new book with a few scratches on the cover.</p><p></p><h2>Italian Renaissance Frames</h2><p>Based on The Metropolitan Museum of Art&#39;s collection of Italian Renaissance frames, this volume presents a fully illustrated survey that traces the Italian frame from its origins in the great Gothic altarpieces.</p><p>Laurence Kanter is Curator-in-Charge of the Robert Lehman Collection at The Metropolitan Museum of Art and is Lionel Goldfrank III Curator of Early European Art at the Yale University Art Gallery.

New forms, including performance and video art, were making their debuts, and sculpture was developing in startling ways. In the midst of it all, experimental abstract painting was pressing art's most iconic medium to its limits and beyond. <i>High Times, Hard Times</i> fills a gap in coverage of this moment in history, recapturing its liveliness and urgency with more than 42 key pieces by 38 artists who were living and working in New York at the time. Many of those featured artists have contributed personal statements reflecting on the work, its meaning and the social scene that surrounded it, including Lynda Benglis, Mel Bochner, Roy Colmer, Mary Corse, David Diao and Peter Young, Guy Goodwin, Harmony Hammond, Mary Heilmann, Cesar Paternosto, Howardena Pindell, Dorothea Rockburne, Carolee Schneemann, Alan Shields, Joan Snyder, Franz Erhard Walther and Jack Whitten, as well as one curator and one critic, Marcia Tucker and Robert Pincus-Witten. The critic Katy Siegel and the painter David Reed have written essays tha focus, respectively, on the work's explosive artistic and political context, and the experience of being a young painter living in New York during these years. Additional pieces by Dawoud Bey and Anna Chave focus on race and gender in that milieu.

Hall lived and worked on reservations in the Southwest, a frontier where four cultures--Navajo, Hopi, Hispanic, and Anglo--clashed. Re-creating that stark and haunting landscape, Hall pieces together a firsthand account of two proud worlds--the frugal, Pueblo-dwelling Hopi with their isolated villages high on the mesa tops and their deeply felt religious faith and the Navajos, whose rhythm and ceremonious forms of respect Hall learned as he worked with them. In these early experiences, as Hall discovered the deeply human logic of these tribes, he began to recognize how culture itself, not only theirs but his own, was at work in each person's behavior. The respect he felt and diplayed won him a friendly Navajo nickname--Chiz Chili, meaning Slim Curly Hair--and a mentor, the great Indian trader, Lorenzo Hubbell. Set under the vast arch of sky in a place of unforgettable beauty, <i>West Of The Thirties</i> is about the Navajos and Hopis as one receptive young white man perceived them, but it is also about the core of being human, which Hall would later develop into a theory of implicit culture. In these pages, we see theory in the flesh, taking a hundred different human forms and engaging us in a lost world, the West of the thirties.<p></p><p>"Hall vividly captures the emotions--fascination, awe, distrust--that accompany excursions into an unknown culture...Particularly enlightening."--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p>"Hall vividly captures the emotions--fascination, awe, distrust--that accompany excursions into an unknown culture...Particularly enlightening."--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><h2>The Typhoon Lover (The Rei Shimura Series, 8)</h2><p><p> A young woman with a foothold in two cultures, Rei Shimura has gone wherever fortune and her unruly passions have led her throughout her chaotic twenties.

She lives in Minneapolis. </p>In Agatha-winner Massey's winning eighth novel to feature Rei Shimura (after 2004's <i>The Pearl Diver</i>), State Department official Michael Hendricks recruits the Japanese-American antiques dealer, who's just turned 30 and is feeling ambivalent about still being single, to locate an ancient ibex ewer that disappeared from a Baghdad museum and is believed to be in the possession of Japanese collector Takeo Kayama, an ex-boyfriend of Rei's. After arriving in Japan just hours ahead of a typhoon that paralyzes the transportation system, Rei contacts her aunt Norie, a teacher at Takeo's flower arranging school, who reveals to her that Takeo's engaged to be married. Only Rei would think the typhoon a perfect cover for checking Takeo's summerhouse for the stolen ewer, and the outcome disastrously affects all concerned. Massey gleefully contrasts the young, bizarrely garbed generation, including Rei's own cousin and Takeo's fianc�e, with traditional Japanese society. Rei winds up with a badly bruised heart, but the ending hints at intriguing future possibilities. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But by the time their first night in the state had ended, three volunteers were dead, black churches had burned, and America had a new definition of freedom. <br><br> This remarkable chapter in American history, the basis for the controversial film <i>Mississippi Burning</i>, is now the subject of Bruce Watson's thoughtful and riveting historical narrative. Using in- depth interviews with participants and residents, Watson brilliantly captures the tottering legacy of Jim Crow in Mississippi and the chaos that brought such national figures as Martin Luther King Jr. and Pete Seeger to the state. <i>Freedom Summer</i> presents finely rendered portraits of the courageous black citizens-and Northern volunteers-who refused to be intimidated in their struggle for justice, and the white Mississippians who would kill to protect a dying way of life. Few books have provided such an intimate look at race relations during the deadliest days of the Civil Rights movement, and Freedom Summer will appeal to readers of Taylor Branch and Doug Blackmon.</p><p>Bruce Watson is an award-winning journalist whose articles have been published in <b>Smithsonian</b>, <b>Los Angeles Times</b>, <b>Boston Globe</b>, <b>San Francisco Examiner</b>, <b>Yankee Magazine</b>, and <b>The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2003</b>.This powerful account of the Civil Rights Movement focuses on the volunteers that descended on Mississippi during the summer of 1964 for the purpose of registering black voters. David Drummond&#39;s narration, like Watson&#39;s story, starts strong and remains so throughout the entire production. Drummond provides a straight narration that proves to be sensitive and animated when the story requires. The combination of well-crafted reporting and Drummond&#39;s moving performance allows the listener to become a witness to a painful and tumultuous chapter in our nation&#39;s history. FREEDOM SUMMER will most certainly remain in the minds of listeners for some time.

He is also the hero of most of the nine stories in this volume. The Op's one enthusiasm is doing his job, and in <b>The Big Knockover</b> the jobs entail taking on a gang of modern-day freebooters, a vice-ridden hell's acre in the Arizona desert, and the bank job to end all bank jobs, along with such assorted grifters as Babe McCloor, Bluepoint Vance, Alphabet Shorty McCoy, and the Dis-and-Dat Kid.</p><p>Dashiell Samuel Hammett was born in St. Mary&#x2019;s County. He grew up in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Hammett left school at the age of fourteen and held several kinds of jobs thereafter&#x2014;messenger boy, newsboy, clerk, operator, and stevedore, finally becoming an operative for Pinkerton&#x2019;s Detective Agency. Sleuthing suited young Hammett, but World War I intervened, interrupting his work and injuring his health. When Sergeant Hammett was discharged from the last of several hospitals, he resumed detective work. He soon turned to writing, and in the late 1920s Hammett became the unquestioned master of detective-story fiction in America. In <b>The Maltese Falcon</b> (1930) he first introduced his famous private eye, Sam Spade. <b>The Thin Man</b> (1932) offered another immortal sleuth, Nick Charles. <b>Red Harvest</b> (1929), <b>The Dain Curse</b> (1929), and <b>The Glass Key</b> (1931) are among his most successful novels. During World War II, Hammett again served as sergeant in the Army, this time for more than two years, most of which he spent in the Aleutians. Hammett&#x2019;s later life was marked in part by ill health, alcoholism, a period of imprisonment related to his alleged membership in the Communist Party, and by his long-time companion, the author Lillian Hellman, with whom he had a very volatile relationship. His attempt at autobiographical fiction survives in the story &#x201c;Tulip,&#x201d; which is contained in the posthumous collection <b>The Big Knockover</b> (1966, edited by Lillian Hellman). Another volume of his stories, <b>The Continental Op</b> (1974, edited by Stephen Marcus), introduced the final Hammett character: the &#x201c;Op,&#x201d; a nameless detective (or &#x201c;operative&#x201d;) who displays little of his personality, making him a classic tough guy in the hard-boiled mold&#x2014;a bit like Hammett himself.1 THE GUTTING OF COUFFIGNAL Wedge-shaped Couffignal is not a large island, and not far from the mainland, to which it is linked by a wooden bridge. Its western shore is a high, straight cliff that jumps abruptly up out of San Pablo Bay. From the top of this cliff the island slopes eastward, down to a smooth pebble beach that runs into the water again, where there are piers and a clubhouse and moored pleasure boats. Couffignal's main street, paralleling the beach, has the usual bank, hotel, moving-picture theater, and stores. But it differs from most main streets of its size in that it is more carefully arranged and preserved. There are trees and hedges and strips of lawn on it, and no glaring signs. The buildings seem to belong beside one another, as if they had been designed by the same architect, and in the stores you will find goods of a quality to match the best city stores. The intersecting streets&#x2014;running between rows of neat cottages near the foot of the slope&#x2014;become winding hedged roads as they climb toward the cliff. The higher these roads get, the farther apart and larger are the houses they lead to. The occupants of these higher houses are the owners and rulers of the island. Most of them are well-fed old gentlemen who, the profits they took from the world with both hands in their younger days now stowed away as safe percentages, have bought into the island colony so they may spend what is left of their lives nursing their livers and improving their golf among their kind. They admit to the island only as many storekeepers, working people, and similar riffraff as are needed to keep them comfortably served. This is Couffignal. It was some time after midnight. I was sitting in a second-story room in Couffignal's largest house, surrounded by wedding presents whose value would add up to something between fifty and a hundred thousand dollars. Of all the work that comes to a private detective (except divorce work, which the Continental Detective Agency doesn't handle) I like weddings as little as any. Usually I manage to avoid them, but this time I hadn't been able to. Dick Foley, who had been slated for the job, had been handed a black eye by an unfriendly pick-pocket the day before. That let Dick out and me in. I had come up to Couffignal--a two-hour ride from San Francisco by ferry and auto stage--that morning, and would return the next. This had been neither better nor worse than the usual wedding detail. The ceremony had been performed in a little stone church down the hill. Then the house had begun to fill with reception guests. They had kept it filled to overflowing until some time after the bride and groom had sneaked off to their eastern train. The world had been well represented. There had been an admiral and an earl or two from England; an ex-president of a South American country; a Danish baron; a tall young Russian princess surrounded by lesser titles, including a fat, bald, jovial and black-bearded Russian general, who had talked to me for a solid hour about prizefights, in which he had a lot of interest, but not so much knowledge as was possible; an ambassador from one of the Central European countries; a justice of the Supreme Court; and a mob of people whose prominence and near-prominence didn't carry labels. In theory, a detective guarding wedding presents is supposed to make himself indistinguishable from the other guests. In practice, it never works out that way. He has to spend most of his time within sight of the booty, so he's easily spotted. Besides that, eight or ten people I recognized among the guests were clients or former clients of the Agency, and so knew me. However, being known doesn't make so much difference as you might think, and everything had gone off smoothly. A couple of the groom's friends, warmed by wine and the necessity of maintaining their reputations as cutups, had tried to smuggle some of the gifts out of the room where they were displayed and hide them in the piano. But I had been expecting that familiar track, and blocked it before it had gone far enough to embarrass anybody. Shortly after dark a wind smelling of rain began to pile storm clouds over the bay. Those guests who lived at a distance, especially those who had water to cross, hurried off for their houses. Those who lived on the island stayed until the first raindrops began to patter down. Then they left. The Hendrixson house quieted down. Musicians and extra servants left. The weary house servants began to disappear in the direction of their bedrooms. I found some sandwiches, a couple of books and a comfortable armchair, and took them up to the room where the presents were now hidden under gray-white sheeting. Keith Hendrixson, the bride's grandfather&#x2014;she was an orphan&#x2014;put his head in at the door. "Have you everything you need for your comfort?" he asked. "Yes, thanks." He said good night and went off to bed--a tall old man, slim as a boy. The wind and the rain were hard at it when I went downstairs to give the lower windows and doors the up-and-down. Everything on the first floor was tight and secure, everything in the cellar. I went upstairs again. Pulling my chair over by a floor lamp, I put sandwiches, books, ashtray, gun and flashlight on a small table beside it. Then I switched off the other lights, set fire to a Fatima, sat down, wriggled my spine comfortably into the chair's padding, picked up one of the books, and prepared to make a night of it. The book was call The Lord of the Sea, and had to do with a strong, tough, and violent fellow named Hogarth, whose modest plan was to hold the world in one hand. There were plots and counterplots, kidnapings, murders, prisonbreakings, forgeries and burglaries, diamonds large as hats and floating forts larger than Couffignal. It sounds dizzy here, but in the book it was real as a dime. Hogarth was still going strong when the lights went out. In the dark, I got rid of the glowing end of my cigarette by grinding it in one of the sandwiches. Putting the book down, I picked up gun and flashlight, and moved away from the chair. Listening for noises was no good. The storm was making hundreds of them. What I needed to know was why the lights had gone off. All the other lights in the house had been turned off some time ago. So the darkness of the hall told me nothing. I waited. My job was to watch the presents. Nobody had touched them yet. There was nothing to get excited about. Minutes went by, perhaps ten of them. The floor swayed under my feet. The windows rattled with a violence beyond the strength of the storm. The dull boom of a heavy explosion blotted out the sounds of wind and falling water. The blast was not close at hand, but not far enough away to be off the island. Crossing to the window, peering through the wet glass, I could see nothing. I should have seen a few misty lights far down the hill. Not being able to see them settled one point. The lights had gone out all over Couffignal, not only in the Hendrixson house. That was better. The storm could have put the lighting system out of whack, could have been responsible for the explosion--maybe. Staring through the black window, I had an impression of great excitement down the hill, of movement in the night. But all was too far away for me to have seen or heard even had there been lights, and all too vague to say what was moving. The impression was strong but worthless. It didn't lead anywhere. I told myself I was getting feeble-minded, and turned away from the window. Another blast spun me back to it. This explosion sounded nearer than the first, maybe because it was stronger. Peering through the glass again, I still saw nothing. And still had the impression of things that were big moving down there. Bare feet pattered in the hall. A voice was anxiously calling my name. Turning from the window again, I pocketed my gun and snapped on the flashlight. Keith Hendrixson, in pajamas and bathrobe, looking thinner and older than anybody could be, came into the room. "Is it&#x2014;" "I don't think it's an earthquake," I said, since that is the first calamity your Californian thinks of. "The lights went off a little while ago. There have been a couple of explosions down the hill since the&#x2014;" I stopped. Three shots, close together, had sounded. Rifle-shots, but of the sort that only the heaviest of rifles could make. Then, sharp and small in the storm, came the report of a far-away pistol. "What is it?" Hendrixson demanded. "Shooting." More feet were pattering in the halls, some bare, some shod. Excited voices whispered questions and exclamations. The butler, a solemn, solid block of a man, partly dressed and carrying a lighted five-pronged candlestick, came in. "Very good, Brophy," Hendrixson said as the butler put the candlestick on the table beside my sandwiches. "Will you try to learn what is the matter?" "I have tried, sir. The telephone seems to be out of order, sir. Shall I send Oliver down to the village?" "No-o. I don't suppose it's that serious. Do you think it is anything serious?" he asked me. I said I didn't think so, but I was paying more attention to the outside than to him. I had heard a thin screaming that could have come from a distant woman, and a volley of small-arms shots. The racket of the storm muffled these shots, but when the heavier firing we had heard before broke out again, it was clear enough. To have opened the window would have been to let in gallons of water without helping us to hear much clearer. I stood with an ear tilted to the pane, trying to arrive at some idea of what was happening outside. Another sound took my attention from the window--the ringing of the bell-pull at the front door. It rang loudly and persistently. Hendrixson looked at me. I nodded. "See who it is, Brophy," he said. The butler went solemnly away, and came back even more solemnly. "Princess Zhukovski," he announced. She came running into the room&#x2014;the tall Russian girl I had seen at the reception. Her eyes were wide and dark with excitement. Her face was very white and wet. Water ran in streams down her blue waterproof cape, the hood of which covered her dark hair. "Oh, Mr. Hendrixson!" She had caught one of his hands in both of hers. Her voice, with nothing foreign in its accent, was the voice of one who is excited over a delightful surprise. "The bank is being robbed and the&#x2014;what do you call him?&#x2014;marshal of police has been killed!" "What's that?" the old man exclaimed, jumping awkwardly because water from her cape had dripped down one of his bare feet. "Weegan killed? And the bank robbed?" "Yes! Isn't it terrible?" She said it as if she were saying wonderful. "When the first explosion woke us, the general sent Ignati down to find out what was the matter, and he got down just in time to see the blank blow up. Listen!" We listened, and heard a wild outbreak of mixed gunfire. "That will be the general arriving!" she said. "He'll enjoy himself most wonderfully. As soon as Ignati returned with the news, the general armed every male in the household from Aleksandr Sergyeevich to Ivan the cook, and led them out happier than he's been since he took his division to East Prussia in 1914." "And the duchess?" Hendrixson asked. "He left her at home with me, of course, and I furtively crept out and away from her while she was trying for the first time in her life to put water in a samovar. This is not the night for one to stay at home!" "H-m-m," Hendrixson said, his mind obviously not on her words. "And the bank!" He looked at me. I said nothing. The racket of another volley came to us. "Could you do anything down there?" he asked. "Maybe, but--" I nodded at the presents under their covers. "Oh, these!" the old man said. "I'm as much interested in the bank as in them; besides, we will be here." "All right!" I was willing enough to carry my curiosity down the hill. "I'll go down. You'd better have the butler stay in here, and plant the chauffeur inside the front door. Better give them guns if you have any. Is there a raincoat I can borrow? I brought only a light overcoat with me." Brophy found a yellow slicker that fit me. I put it on, stowed gun and flashlight conveniently under it, and found my hat while Brophy was getting and loading an automatic pistol for himself and a rifle for Oliver, the mulatto chauffeur. Hendrixson and the princess followed me downstairs. At the door I found she wasn't exactly following me--she was going with me. "But, Sonya!" the old man protested. "I'm not going to be foolish, though I'd like to," she promised him. "But I'm going back to my Irinia Androvna, who will perhaps have the samovar watered by now. "That's a sensible girl!" Hendrixson said, and let us out into the rain and the wind. It wasn't weather to talk in. In silence we turned downhill between two rows of hedging, with the storm driving at our backs. At the first break in the hedge I stopped, nodding toward the black blot a house made. "That is your&#x2014;" Her laugh cut me short. She caught my arm and began to urge me down the road again. "I only told Mr. Hendrixson that so he would not worry," she explained. "You do not think I am not going down to see the sights." She was tall, I am short and thick. I had to look up to see her face&#x2014;to see as much of it as the rain-gray night would let me see. "You'll be soaked to the hide, running around in this rain," I objected. "What of that? I am dressed for it." She raised a foot to show me a heavy waterproof boot and a woolen-stockinged leg. "There's no telling what we'll run into down there, and I've got work to do," I insisted. "I can't be looking out for you." "I can look out for myself." She pushed her cape aside to show me a square automatic pistol in one hand.</p><h2>The People in the Trees [Paperback] [Jan 01, 2012] Hanya Yanagihara</h2><p>People-in-the-Trees</p><p>Hanya Yanagihara lives in New York City.I.<br><br>I was born in 1924 near Lindon, Indiana, the sort of small, unremarkable rural town that some twenty years before my birth had begun to duplicate itself, quietly but insistently, across the Midwest. By which I mean that the town, as I remember it, was exceptional only for its very lack of distinguishing details. There were silos, and red barns (most of the residents were farmers), and general stores, and churches, and ministers and doctors and teachers and men and women and children: an outline for an American society, but one with no flourishes, no decoration, no accessories. There were a few drunks, and a resident madman, and dogs and cats, and a county fair that was held in tandem with Locust, an incorporated town a few miles to the west that no longer exists. The townspeople--there were eighteen hundred of us--were born, and went to school, and did chores, and became farmers, and married Lindonites, and began families of their own. When you saw someone in the street, you&#x2019;d nod to him or, if you were a man, pull down the brim of your hat a bit. The seasons changed, the tobacco and corn grew and were harvested. That was Lindon.<br><br>There were four of us in the family: my father, my mother, and Owen and me.<b> (1)</b>&nbsp;We lived on a hundred acres of land, in a sagging house whose only notable characteristic was a massive, once-grand central staircase that long before had been transformed by generations of termites into a lacy ruin.<br><br>About a mile behind the house ran a curvy creek, too small and slow and behaviorally inconsistent to warrant a proper name. Every March and April, after the winter thaw, it would surpass its limitations and become a proper river, swollen and aggressive with gallons of melted snow and spring rain. During those months, the creek&#x2019;s very nature changed. It became merciless and purposeful, and seized from its outgrown banks tiny, starry bloodroot blossoms and wild thyme by their roots and whisked them downstream, where they were abandoned in the thicket of a dam someone unknown had built long ago. Minnows, the creek&#x2019;s year-round inhabitants, fought upstream and drowned. For that one season, the creek had a voice: an outraged roar of rushing water, of power, and that narrow tributary, normally so placid and characterless, became during those months something frightening and unpredictable, and we were warned to keep away.<br><br>But in the heat of the summer months, the creek--which didn&#x2019;t originate at our property but rather at the Muellers&#x2019;, who lived about five miles to the east--dried once again to a meek trickle, timorously creeping its way past our farm. The air above it would be noisy with clouds of buzzing mosquitoes and dragonflies, and leeches would suck along its soft silty bottom. We used to go fishing there, and swimming, and afterward would climb back up the low hill to our house, scratching at the mosquito welts on our arms and legs until they became furry with old skin and new blood.<br><br>My father never ventured down to the creek, but my mother used to like to sit on the grass and watch the water lick over her ankles. When we were very young, we would call out to her--Look at us!--and she would lift her head dreamily and wave, though she was just as likely to wave at us as she was to wave at, say, a nearby oak sapling. (Our mother&#x2019;s sight was fine, but she often behaved as a blind person would; she moved through the world as a sleepwalker.) By the time Owen and I were seven or eight or so (at any rate, too young to have become disenchanted with her), she had become an object of at first pity and, soon after, of fun. We&#x2019;d wave at her, sitting on the bank, her arms crossed under her knees, and then, as she was waving back at us (with her whole arm rather than simply her hand, like a clump of seaweed listing underwater), we&#x2019;d turn away, talk loudly to each other, pretend not to see her. Later, over dinner, when she&#x2019;d ask what we&#x2019;d done at the creek, we&#x2019;d act astonished, perplexed. The creek? But we hadn&#x2019;t been there! We were playing in the fields all day.<br><br>&#x201c;But I saw you there,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say.<br><br>No, we&#x2019;d tell her in unison, shaking our heads. It must have been two other boys. Two other boys who looked just like us.<br><br>&#x201c;But--&#x201d; she&#x2019;d begin, and her face would seize for a moment in confusion before clearing. &#x201c;It must have been,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say uncertainly, and look down at her plate.<br><br>This exchange occurred several times a month. It was a game for us, but an unsettling one. Was our mother playing along? But the look that crossed her face--of real worry, of fear that she was, as we said back then, not right, that she was unable to trust or believe her sight or memory--seemed too real, too spontaneous. We chose to believe that she was acting, for the alternative, that she was mad or, worse, genuinely moronic, was too frightening to contemplate seriously. Later, in our room, Owen and I would imitate her (&#x201c;But--but--but--it was you!&#x201d;) and laugh, but afterward, lying in our beds, silent, considering the game&#x2019;s implications, we were troubled. We were young, but we both knew (from books, from our peers) what a mother was expected to do--to chastise, to teach, to instruct, to discipline if necessary--and furthermore, we both knew our mother was not fit for those tasks. What, we wondered, would we grow up to become under such a woman? Why was she so incapable? We treated her like most boys would treat small animals: kindly when we were feeling happy and generous, cruelly when we were not. It was intoxicating to know we had the power to make her shoulders relax, to make her lips part in an uncertain smile, and yet also to make her turn her face down, to make her rub her palm quickly against her leg, which she did when she was nervous or unhappy or confused. Despite our concerns, we never spoke of them aloud; the only discussions we had about her were tinged with derision or disgust. Worry pulled us closer to each other, made us ever bolder and more obnoxious. Surely, we thought, we would push her to a point where the real adult she&#x2019;d kept cloaked so well would reveal itself. Like most children, we assumed all adults were naturally imbued with a sense of intimidation, of authority.<br><br>Besides her lack of substance, there were fundamental ways in which my mother might be considered a failure. She was a slipshod cook (her steamed broccoli was rubbery, its florets bristling with the crunchy carcasses of minuscule unseen beetles, her roasted chicken squeaky with blood) and an only occasional housekeeper--our father had bought her a vacuum cleaner, but it sat neglected in the coat closet until Owen and I one day dissected it for its parts. Nor did she seem to have any interests. We never saw her reading or writing or painting or gardening, all pastimes that we (even then) knew were of intrinsic worth and interest. On summer afternoons, we&#x2019;d sometimes find her sitting in the living room, her legs tucked under her girlishly, a silly smile on her face, staring fixedly yet vacantly at a vast constellation of dust motes made visible by a stripe of sunlight.<br><br>Once I saw her praying. I went into the living room one afternoon after school and found her on her knees, her palms pressed together, her head lifted. Her lips were moving, but I couldn&#x2019;t hear what she was saying. She looked ridiculous, like an actress playing to an empty theater, and I was embarrassed for her. &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; I asked, and she looked up, alarmed. &#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; she said, startled. But I knew what she was doing and knew too that she was lying.<br><br>What else can I say? I can say she was vague, drifty, probably even stupid. But here I must also say that she has remained an enigma to me, which is a difficult thing for any human to accomplish. And there are other things I remember of her as well: she was tall, and graceful, and although I am unable to recollect the specificities of her face, I know she was somewhat beautiful. An old, blurred sepia photograph Owen has hanging in his office confirms this. She was probably not considered as beautiful then as she would be now, for her face was ahead of her times--long, white, startled: a face that promised intelligence, mystery, depth. Today she would be called arresting. But my father must have considered her very beautiful, for I can think of no other reason that he might have married her. My father, when he spoke to women at all, enjoyed well-educated women, though he did not find them in any way sexually appealing. I assume this is because intelligent women reminded him of his sister, Sybil, who was a doctor in Rochester and whom he admired enormously. So he was left with beauty. It disappointed me when I discerned as an adolescent that my father had married my mother only for her beauty, but this was before I realized that parents disappoint us in many ways and it is best not to expect anything of them at all, for chances are that they won&#x2019;t be able to deliver it.<br><br>Mostly, though, she was unknowable. I don&#x2019;t even know where she came from exactly (somewhere in Nebraska, I believe), but I do know she was from a poor family, and my father, with his relative fortune and undemanding nature, had saved her. But curiously, for all her poverty, there was nothing work-worn or used about her; she did not appear to be depleted, nor hardened. Rather, she gave the impression of being one of those indulged women who floats from her father&#x2019;s home to the finishing school and into her husband&#x2019;s arms. (The glow that seems to surround her in Owen&#x2019;s photograph, her early, quiet death, her sleepy, slow movements, all make me remember her as luminous, protected, cosseted, even though I know otherwise.) As far as I know, she had no education (reading our report cards aloud to my father, she stumbled over words: &#x201c;Ex-, ex-em-pu,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d sound out before Owen or I would shout out the word--Exemplary--to her, smug and impatient and ashamed), and she was very young when she died.<br><br>But then too, she was young in all things. In my memories she is persistently childlike, not only in behavior but in appearance as well. Her hair, for example: no matter the occasion, she wore it loose, rippling down her back in a loose, snaking helix. Even when I was a child, this hairstyle of hers was troublesome to me; I saw it as further evidence of a rigorously, inappropriately maintained girlhood--the long hair, the distant, vacuous smile, the way her eyes would wander from yours the moment you began to speak to her, all things not admirable in a woman with her supposed responsibilities.<br><br>It is discomfiting to me now, as I list these few details of my mother&#x2019;s life, how little I know and how incurious I have remained about her. I suppose every child yearns to understand his parental origins, but I never found her an interesting enough person to consider. (Or should that reasoning be inverted?) But then, I have never believed in romancing the past--what good would it do me? Owen, however, later became much more interested in our mother, and even passed through a period as an undergraduate in which he attempted to trace her family and complete an informal biography of her. He abandoned the project months after its inception, however, and became very defensive about it when asked, so I can only assume he found our maternal relatives without much trouble, realized they were yokels, and gave the whole thing up in disgust (he was still enough of an avowed elitist back then to do exactly that).<b> (2)</b>&nbsp;She has always mattered to him in a way that I have never been able to understand. But then, Owen is a poet, and I believe he thought it important that he have these details available for future employment, however mediocre or ultimately disappointing they may have been.<br><br>At any rate. It was July of 1933. I hesitate to say &#x201c;It was a day like any other,&#x201d; for it sounds so melodramatic and portentous, as well as wholly unbelievable. Yet it is also true. So: it was a day like any other. My father was off with his friend Lester Drew, a small-time farmer, doing whatever it was two small-time farmers did together. Owen and I were gathering a bucket of leeches that we planned to bake into a pie and then give to Ida, the part-time cook, a sour woman we both hated. My mother was dangling her feet in the stream.<br><br>For weeks afterward, Owen and I would be asked to try to remember--had anything seemed different about her that afternoon? Had she seemed listless, or ill, or particularly fatigued? Had she spoken to us of feeling dizzy or weak? But the answer was always no. Indeed, if I can tell you very little about my mother&#x2019;s actions or mood that day, it is probably because they so closely resembled what we had come to accept as her normal behavior. As exasperating as our mother was, we could never accuse her of inconsistency. Even her last day of life followed that same inscrutable rhythm that only she could decipher.<br><b>(1)</b>&nbsp;The Owen to whom Norton refers is Owen C. Perina, Norton&#x2019;s twin brother and one of the few significant adult relationships in his life. Unlike Norton, Owen was always interested in literature, and he is now a renowned poet and the Field--Patey Professor of Poetry at Bard College. He has also twice been awarded the National Book Award for poetry, once for The Insect&#x2019;s Hand and Other Poems (1984) and again for The Pillow Book of Philip Perina (1995), as well as numerous other commendations. Owen is as famously taciturn as Norton is voluble, and I once witnessed a very amusing exchange between them when I visited Norton a few Christmases ago. There was Norton, fist full of chestnuts, spewing, chewing, gesticulating, holding forth on everything from the dying art of butterfly mounting to the strange appeal of a certain talk show, and across from him, his lumpish mirror image, grunting and murmuring his occasional assent or dissent, was Owen. Sadly, Norton and his brother are now at irreconcilable odds. As these pages will reveal, their estrangement was abrupt and devastating, the result of a terrible betrayal, one from which Norton will never recover.<br><br><b>(2)</b>&nbsp;Owen Perina has written a rather lovely poem about his mother and her death; it is the first poem in his third collection, Moth and Honey (1986).</p><h2>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (Covey S)</h2><p>In the groundbreaking book, &#39;The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People&#39;, Stephen R.

Reprint.</p><p>The greatest fantasies of the 20th century are J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea Cycle. Regrettably, the Earthsea Cycle has not received the fame and sales of Tolkien's trilogy. Fortunately, new Earthsea books have appeared in the 21st century, and they are as powerful, beautiful, and imaginative as the first four novels. The fifth novel and sixth book of the Earthsea Cycle is <i>The Other Wind</i>.<p> The sorcerer Alder has the power of mending, but it may have become the power of destruction: every night he dreams of the wall between the land of the living and the land of the dead, and the wall is being dismantled. If the wall is breached, the dead will invade Earthsea. Ged, once Archmage of Earthsea, sends Alder to King Lebannen. Now Alder and the king must join with a burned woman, a wizard of forbidden lore, and a being who is woman and dragon both, in an impossible quest to save Earthsea.</p><p> Ursula K.

A Woman in Berlin stands as &#34;one of the essential books for understanding war and life&#34; (A. S. Byatt, author of Possession).</p><p></p><h2>From Lucy To Language</h2><p><p> In 1974 in a remote region of Ethiopia, Donald Johanson, then one of America's most promising young paleoanthropologists, discovered "Lucy", the oldest, best preserved skeleton of any erect-walking human ever found. This discovery prompted a complete reevaluation of previous evidence for human origins. </p><p> In the years since this dramatic discovery Johanson has continued to scour East Africa's Great rift Valley for the earliest evidence of human origins. In 1975 this team unearthed the "First Family", an unparalleled fossil assemblage of 13 individuals dating back to 3.2 million years ago; and in 1986 at the Rift's most famous location, Olduvai Gorge, this same team discovered a 1.8 million-year-old partial adult skeleton that necessitated a reassessment of the earliest members of our own genus <i>Homo.</i> </p><p> Johanson's fieldwork continues unabated and recently more fossil members of Lucy's family have been found, including the 1992 discovery of the oldest, most complete skull of her species, with future research now planned for 1996 in the virtually unexplored regions of the most northern extension of the Rift Valley in Eritrea. </p><p> <i>From Lucy to Language</i> is a summing up of this remarkable career and a stunning documentary of human life through time on Earth. It is a combination of the vital experience of field work and the intellectual rigor of primary research. It is the fusion of two great writing talents: Johanson and Blake Edgar, an accomplished science writer, editor of the California Academy of Sciences' <i>Pacific Discovery,</i> and co-author of Johanson's last book, <i>Ancestors.</i> </p><p> <i>From Lucy to Language</i> is one of the greatest stories ever told, bracketing the timeline between bipedalism and human language. Part I addresses the central issues facing anyone seeking to decipher the mystery of human origins. In this section the authors provide answers to the basics -- "What are our closest living relatives?" -- tackle the controversial -- "What is race?" -- and contemplate the imponderables -- "Why did consciousness evolve?" </p><p> <i>From Lucy to Language</i> is an encounter with the evidence. Early human fossils are hunted, discovered, identified, excavated, collected, preserved, labeled, cleaned, reconstructed, drawn, fondled, photographed, cast, compared, measured, revered, pondered, published, and argued over endlessly. Fossils like Lucy have become a talisman of sorts, promising to reveal the deepest secrets of our existence. In Part II the authors profile over fifty of the most significant early human fossils ever found. Each specimen is displayed in color and at actual size, most of them in multiple views. With them the authors present the cultural accoutrements associated with the fossils: stone tools which evidence increasing sophistication over time, the earliest stone, clay, and ivory art objects, and the culminating achievement of the dawn of human consciousness -- the magnificent rock and cave paintings of Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. </p><p> In the end <i>From Lucy to Language</i> is a reminder and a challenge. Like no species before us, we now seem poised to control vast parts of the planet and its life. We possess the power to influence, if not govern, evolution. For that reason, we must not forget our link to the natural world and our debt to natural selection. We need to "think deep", to add a dose of geologic time and evolutionary history to our perspective of who we are, where we came from, and where we are headed. This is the most poignant lesson this book has to offer.</p></p><p>In recent decades new fossil discoveries have redefined perceptions of human evolution at a remarkable pace, making it nearly impossible for the general reader to find an up-to-date account of the subject. This large-format book by science writer Edgar and paleoanthropologist Johanson--discoverer of the famous partial skeleton of "Lucy," a female hominid who lived 3.2 million years ago--gives as complete a picture as is presently known. Much mystery remains, but the earlier view of human evolution as a linear progression from apes through the hominids to the various <i>homo</i> species has been replaced by a more treelike analogue, one with many branches of upright-walking hominids. Truly a photo album of hominid history, the volume includes more than 200 color pictures of the major fossil discoveries, each with explanatory text.<b>Donald Johanson</b> has explored the Great Rift Valley of East Africa for more than two decades, seeking clues to our ultimate origins. One of the most lively and controversial scientists working today, he is the author of five previous books, the host of the three-part Nova series <i>In Search of Human Origins,</i> and continues to lecture regularly.

She was born in Monrovia, Liberia, and lives in the Washington, DC area.Madame President Chapter 1<p></p> THE PROPHECY<p></p> Monrovia, 1938<p></p> <br>In Liberia, a woman&#x2019;s place is in the market, the church, the kitchen, or the bed. But not for one little girl.<br> <br>One little girl, delivered in the back bedroom of her family&#x2019;s house on Benson Street in Monrovia on October 29, 1938, was, her relatives believed, destined for great things. After all, the Old Man, one of the many prophets who wandered through Monrovia spreading their wisdom, predicted it when he showed up at Carney and Martha Johnson&#x2019;s half-concrete house days after the birth of baby Ellen&#x2014;nicknamed Red Pumpkin because she was &#x201c;red like one pumpkin&#x201d;&#x2014;to have a look at the baby. &#x201c;This child will be great,&#x201d; he said, after peering into the crib. &#x201c;This child is going to lead.&#x201d;<br> <br>Actually, that is not what he said&#x2014;no Liberian talks like that. Decades later, when Ellen Johnson Sirleaf wrote her own autobiography, she titled it This Child Will Be Great, referencing the Old Man&#x2019;s prophecy.<br> <br>She was anglicizing it, assuming an international audience wouldn&#x2019;t understand Liberian English, which can be perfectly transparent one moment and perfectly impenetrable the next. It is not pidgin, the West African English that evolved from England&#x2019;s colonial efforts at communicating with Africans. But there is pidgin in Liberian English. Nor is it Creole (see above; insert French). But there is Creole in Liberian English as well.<br> <br>Instead, Liberian English is a wonderful hodgepodge of all of the above, an international language that borrows freely from British phrasings and American slang, with the added seasoning of the American South, courtesy of the freed American slaves who settled the country, the twenty-eight different ethnic groups who met the slaves when they arrived, and the African parables that are part of daily life.<br> <br>In Liberia, people talk in continuous parable. Most of the time it makes sense.<br> <br>&#x201c;Crab baby die, crab don&#x2019;t cry, da big-eye bumpy here crying?&#x201d; (Translation: Why is Marcia more upset about Jan&#x2019;s ugly afro than Jan is?)<br> <br>&#x201c;Fanti man won&#x2019;t say his fish rotten.&#x201d; (Do you seriously expect a Chelsea fan to admit they are an awful football club?)<br> <br>&#x201c;Me and monkey ain&#x2019;t make no palaver.&#x201d; (Why would I turn my nose up at eating the nice monkey meat you put in that palm butter? I&#x2019;ve got nothing against monkeys.)<br> <br>&#x201c;Ehn you know book?&#x201d; (You&#x2019;re the one with the Ph.D. You figure it out.)<br> <br>&#x201c;I going walkabout.&#x201d; (I&#x2019;m going out to visit people, probably a secret boyfriend, and it&#x2019;s none of your business who, so leave me alone.)<br> <br>&#x201c;Monkey work, Baboon draws.&#x201d; (I do the work, you relax and enjoy yourself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ma, de pekin wa&#x2019; na easy oh.&#x201d; (This child will be great.)<br> <br>Armed with that prophecy, which her family repeated to her throughout her childhood, Ellen set out to create what would become an extraordinary life. Because before she even uttered her first word, certain things had already been put in place that determined she would be no ordinary Liberian woman.<br> <br>For this, blame America.<br> <br>In the early nineteenth century, America found itself with a growing class of freed blacks, many of them the children of slaves who had somehow found themselves freed, for reasons ranging from happenstance to, in many cases, interracial rape. White slave owners had impregnated their slaves, who then had mixed-raced children whose skin color was a daily reminder of the hypocrisy that infused antebellum life. Many of these mixed-race children were eventually freed.<br> <br>The rising number of freed blacks worried the white slave owners, who believed they served as a beacon to enslaved blacks who might rebel and seek their own freedom. And so began the &#x201c;back to Africa&#x201d; movement, centered around the thought that the best way to prevent slave rebellions was to send free blacks back to Africa.<br> <br>In 1820 the first of many shiploads of mixed-race freed slaves and blacks headed to West Africa. Mulatto, Quadroon, Quintoon, Octaroon&#x2014;these new colonists were, for the most part, lighter-skinned than the native Liberian population; they could read and write; and they were ostentatiously Christian. The colonists were met by locals who suspected&#x2014;rightly&#x2014;that their land and way of life (many of them still actively engaged in the slave trade themselves) were under threat. This was not as morally complicated as it sounds. The Europeans did have to purchase their human cargo from someone, and that someone was usually Africans who had caught and enslaved other Africans. So, many locals in Liberia were worried that this practice would be stopped by the newly arrived former slaves.<br> <br>And thus was born Liberia, a country of almost impossible social, religious, and political complexity.<br> <br>The American Colonization Society, a group made up of an unholy combination of white antislavery Quakers and evangelicals and slave owners who wanted to rid their South of freed blacks, purchased land from the native Africans. The Society did this at gunpoint and named the new country Liberia. The freed slaves who colonized Liberia were now the ruling class, and the native Africans largely became the laborers, household help, and underclass.<br> <br>Liberia is three thousand miles from the Congo, but the black American settlers became known derisively as &#x201c;Congo people&#x201d; because native Liberians associated the Congo River with the slave trade. The Congo people controlled the government and owned most of the land. They quickly outlawed the slave trade that had provided income to many of the native Liberians, whom the Congo people referred to insultingly as &#x201c;country people.&#x201d;<br> <br>To the American colonists, the &#x201c;country people&#x201d; were an unvariegated mass, with their elaborate beaded jewelry, Fanti clothing, and incomprehensible language. But these were complicated people, from twenty-eight different ethnic groups, with individual beliefs, practices, and centuries-old enmities. The Kru were fishermen who hated slavery. The Krahn brokered deals in slave markets. The Gio came from a line of Sudanese warriors who never ran away from a fight. No one is sure why, but the Gio and Krahn seemed to hate each other.<br> <br>After several bloody battles in the initial years after their arrival, the American colonists eventually imposed themselves on Liberia&#x2019;s Gio, Krahn, Bassa, and Kru. What developed next was a symbiotic relationship, particularly in matters of faith. From the Congo people, native Liberians took Christianity. But not the more refined European version. Liberians seized on the robust Christianity of gospel hymns, prayers, and beliefs that the Congo people had brought with them from the land of slavery. The suffering of Jesus Christ and the enslavement of the ancient Jews were things American slaves had intuitively understood. The delivery of his people by Moses, the selling into slavery of Joseph by his brothers, the throwing of Daniel into a lion&#x2019;s den captured the imagination of the slaves in America.<br> <br>The Christianity they took with them to Africa was altered dramatically by the native Liberians, who added their own religious interpretations and traditions, including exuberant beating of drums, dancing, singing, and speaking in tongues, creating the background music that the country sways to today.<br> <br>So when baby Ellen was born, it was to two deeply divided societies that were linked by religion. Yet she, like few others, would not need religion to straddle both groups.<br> <br>On the outside, Ellen looked like a Congo baby, but she did not have a single drop of Congo blood. She was a native Liberian, a point that would become hugely significant in the coming decades, when the Congo people were finally brought low. Her father&#x2019;s father was a Gola chief named Jahmale. He had eight wives ensconced in the picturesque village of Julejuah, in Bomi County. He and one wife did what so many Liberians do routinely: they sent one of their sons&#x2014;Ellen&#x2019;s father, Karnley&#x2014;to Monrovia to become a ward of a Congo family. There Karnley could go to school and acquire the refinement that, in early twentieth-century Liberia, was becoming acknowledged as necessary to make something of yourself. Karnley&#x2019;s name was Westernized to Carney Johnson, beginning the slow Congoization of the family.<br> <br>Ellen&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s mother was a Kru market woman from Greenville, Sinoe County, named Juah Sarwee, who fell for a white man, a German trader named Heinz Kreuger, who was living in Liberia. The two married in 1913 and had a daughter, Martha.<br> <br>During World War I, Liberia, eager to show the United States its loyalty, declared war on Germany and expelled all Germans, including Heinz. He left his family behind and was never heard from again. But thanks to Heinz Kreuger and Juah Sarwee, Ellen&#x2019;s mother, Martha, would go through life with what was then the ultimate symbol of beauty and status in a country with so many hang-ups about race: long hair and light skin. She could almost pass for white. The Congo families soon started offering to take her into their homes&#x2014;common practice in Liberia, where better-off families often took in poorer children who served as playmates (and sometimes servants) for the children of the house in exchange for room, board, and schooling. Eventually Juah Sarwee, who was poor, illiterate, and abandoned by the white man she had married, agreed to give her daughter away.<br> <br>The first Congo family Martha lived with made her sleep on the kitchen table, or sometimes under it with the family animals. Early twentieth-century Liberian society might accept that fate for a native, dark-skinned child, but Monrovia wouldn&#x2019;t tolerate such treatment of a light-skinned half-white girl. So another Congo couple, Cecilia and Charles Dunbar, stepped in to right the wrong.<br> <br>Martha took the Dunbar name, went to the best schools in Liberia, then headed abroad for a year to acquire even more refinement. She came back and was in the yard of the Dunbar house when Ellen&#x2019;s father, now Carney Johnson, spotted her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said, taking in the hair, figure, and flushed high-yellow skin. &#x201c;Oh. I like you.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Martha and Carney&#x2019;s four children&#x2014;first Charles, then Jennie, Ellen, and Carney&#x2014;would grow up with the gift of camouflage in a fractured country. Among the Congo people they could easily fit in, yet their Gola roots also gave them an entr�e, should they ever want to use it, into native Liberian culture. Ellen, the third child, in particular had the ability to use the gift with which she was born.<br> <br>She looked Congo, and like most Congo people, she spoke two languages: English and Liberian English. She certainly lived Congo: she went to school with the Congo kids and lived in a real cement house on Benson Street with a big yard surrounded by coconut trees and filled with fruit and flower bushes. Her older sister even went to school in England, a prized status that was the height of Congoness. By local standards, the family was upper middle class, thanks to Martha&#x2019;s light skin, but especially to Carney&#x2019;s profession as a lawyer. He was eventually elected to the Liberian House of Representatives, the first native Liberian to do so.<br> <br>Ellen was four years old when William V. S. Tubman was elected president in 1943. Luckily for their family, the president appeared to like her father. Tubman would often dispatch Johnson abroad to represent the country, and when Johnson returned from such trips, the president sometimes visited the family home with his entourage, an event that certainly enhanced their standing in society but led to mayhem in the kitchen as servants and helpers cooked palm butter, jollof rice&#x2014;the proper Liberian jollof rice, with chicken and ham hock and beef in it&#x2014;and fufu for the head of state. Naturally Ellen and her siblings were banished from the living room, but Ellen always hid around the corner to listen.<br> <br>Ellen was firmly in the ruling Congo class, except when she didn&#x2019;t want to be. She attended the College of West Africa, an elite high school. During vacations, she and her sister and brothers went to Julejuah, the village in Bomi County where their father was born. Julejuah was twenty miles from Monrovia, but the road ended well before the village, so their car could take them only to that point. Men carried Ellen and her siblings in hammocks the rest of the way.<br> <br>Once in Julejuah, Ellen and the boys&#x2014;Jennie turned her nose up at such tomboyish behavior&#x2014;climbed trees, swam in the river, hitched rides in the canoe that ferried people from one bank to the other, and sat under a tree out of the hot sun with their grandmother eyeing the birds that approached the growing rice. Recognizing that Jennie was their father&#x2019;s favorite, Ellen and her brothers sent her to canoodle sweets and favors from him. They learned a smattering of Gola words, the language of their ancestors. Those few phrases would one day save Ellen&#x2019;s life.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Throughout Ellen&#x2019;s growing-up years, her family reminded her, often with irony, that she was a pekin who wa&#x2019; na easy oh, destined for greatness. Often they brought it up when she did something that didn&#x2019;t seem so great. Like, for instance, the day she fell into the latrine.<br> <br>The family house on Benson Street was luxurious by the standards of 1950s Liberia: a two-story concrete structure with a big yard. But it didn&#x2019;t have an indoor bathroom; an outdoor latrine of rough plank boards over a deep hole was the family toilet. Once, when she was small, Ellen fell in. She hollered and carried on until a passing neighbor pulled her out and helped her mother wash her off.<br> <br>The family invoked the prophecy when Ellen made her first public speech, at the age of eight. Or, at least, she tried to, spending the whole afternoon the day before her much anticipated Sunday recitation sitting under a guava tree memorizing her lines. Alas, when she was called before the congregation at church the next morning, she froze, looking at her mother&#x2019;s agonized face, standing there for minute after unbearable minute. Finally, the congregation started clapping in sympathy, and Ellen, tears running down her face, returned to her seat in disgrace.<br> <br>They should definitely have invoked the prophecy when, at the age of seventeen, Ellen became a bride.<br> <br>It was 1956, and the once-prosperous family had had a change of fortune. Carney Johnson had suffered a stroke that paralyzed his right side. &#x201c;I have been witched,&#x201d; he informed his family. &#x201c;Someone has put juju on me.&#x201d; In Liberia it is still common for people to reach for ominous explanations for otherwise scientifically explicable phenomena. His wife also eschewed the scientific for the less tangible. &#x201c;Pray for healing and for the forgiveness of your sins,&#x201d; Martha advised her husband.<br> <br>Carney&#x2019;s speech and movement were compromised by the stroke, and with that, his hopes of becoming the first native Liberian speaker of the House died. His past closeness to the ruling class wasn&#x2019;t enough to insulate his family from the results of his vanished income. Martha quickly turned to the Liberian woman&#x2019;s standard for survival, marketing, and began making baked goods to sell. She also took over the all-encompassing care and feeding of her now-homebound husband, rising early to bathe, dress, and feed him before helping him to the chair on the porch where he spent his days staring out at the street.<br> <br>At sixteen Ellen was nearing the end of high school, hoping that she wo...</p><h2>Loving Day: A Novel</h2><p><b>A <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> NOTABLE BOOK |&nbsp;<b>NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>MIAMI HERALD </i>AND ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>San Francisco Chronicle �&nbsp;</i>NPR �&nbsp;<i>Men&#x2019;s Journal � The Denver Post �&nbsp;Slate �&nbsp;The Kansas City Star �&nbsp;Time Out New York</i></b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</b>From the author of the critically beloved <i>Pym</i> (&#x201c;Imagine Kurt Vonnegut having a beer with Ralph Ellison and Jules Verne.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Vanity Fair</i>) comes a ruthlessly comic and moving tale of a man discovering a lost daughter, confronting an elusive ghost, and stumbling onto the possibility of utopia.<br><br> <i>&#x201c;In the ghetto there is a mansion, and it is my father&#x2019;s house.&#x201d;</i><br><br> Warren Duffy has returned to America for all the worst reasons: His marriage to a beautiful Welsh woman has come apart; his comics shop in Cardiff has failed; and his Irish American father has died, bequeathing to Warren his last possession, a roofless, half-renovated mansion in the heart of black Philadelphia.

It sits on seven acres, surrounded by growling row homes, frozen in an architectural class war. Its expansive lawn is utterly useless, wild like it smokes its own grass and dreams of being a jungle. The street around it is even worse: littered with the disposables no one could bother to put in a can, the cars on their last American owner, the living dead roaming slow and steady to nowhere. And this damn house, which killed my father, is as big as it is old, decaying to gray pulp yet somehow still standing there, with its phallic white pillars and the intention of eternity. An eighteenth-century estate in the middle of the urban depression of Germantown. Before he died, my father bought the wreck at auction, planned on restoring it to its original state, just like he did for so many smaller houses in the neighborhood. Rescuing a slice of colonial history to sell it back to the city for a timeless American profit. His plan didn&#x2019;t include being old, getting sick, or me having to come back to this country, to this city, to pick up his pieces. This house is a job for a legion, not one person. It would kill one person. It did&#x2014;my father. I am one person now. My father&#x2019;s house is on me. I see it from the back of the cab, up on its hill, rotting.<br><br>Donated by the Loudin family after the Depression, the mansion was used by the city as a museum until a fire that created repair costs beyond its means and interest. At one point in my life, decades before, I was a boy. As such, I knew this house. I used to ride the 23 trolley past its absurd presence and marvel at this artifact of rich white folks&#x2019; attempt at dynasty. A physical memory of historic Germantown&#x2019;s pastoral roots, before the larger city of Philadelphia exploded past this location, propelled by the force of the industrial revolution. Most things from childhood get smaller with age, but Loudin Mansion towers, because now I have to take care of it. So I want to run. I sit passively in the taxi as I&#x2019;m driven closer, but my thighs ache and my bowels are prepared to evacuate, and I want to open the door and run. I&#x2019;ll run. I&#x2019;ll run through North Philly if I have to, all the way downtown. Run along the highway back to the airport, then run away again from the whole damn country.<br><br>The white cabdriver makes no move to get out with me when he finally stops, just pops the trunk open with one button and with another relocks the doors after I open mine. That lock clicks hard. I&#x2019;m on the street with my bags, and I can&#x2019;t get back inside. I&#x2019;m not white, but I can feel the eyes of the few people outside on me, people who must think that I am, because I look white, and as such what the hell am I doing here? This disconnect in my racial projection is one of the things I hate. It goes in a subcategory I call &#x201c;America,&#x201d; which has another subheading called &#x201c;Philly.&#x201d; I hate that because I know I&#x2019;m black. My mother was black&#x2014;that counts, no matter how pale and Irish my father was. So I shall not be rebuked. I will not be rejected. I want to run but I refuse to be run off.<br><br>A kid walks by, about seventeen, not much younger than I was when I escaped this neighborhood. He looks up, and as I lift my bags I give him the appropriate local response, an expression that says I&#x2019;m having a bad life in general and a headache right now. Welcome home. There are blocks around here where you can be attacked for looking another man in the eyes, and other blocks where you can be assaulted for not giving the respect of eye contact. I could never figure it, which blocks were which, until I realized these were just the excuses of sociopaths. The sociopaths, that&#x2019;s the real problem. The whole street demeanor is about pretending to be a sociopath as well, so that the real ones can&#x2019;t find you.<br><br>When I get to the porch, the front door opens. I can hear it creak before I see someone emerging from behind its paint-cracked surface. Sirleaf Day is carpeted in cloth. He&#x2019;s got a Kenyan dashiki, Sudanese mudcloth pants, and a little Ghanian kente hat. It&#x2019;s like Africa finally united, but just in his wardrobe. Last time I saw him, he dressed the same, but he only had one leather medallion. Now he has enough to be the most decorated general in the Afrocentric army. I give him a &#x201c;Howyadoin,&#x201d; and the Philly salute, a hummingbird-like vibration of my forehead, the most defensive of nods. He gives me a hug. He hugs me like he knows I&#x2019;m trying to get away.<br><br>&#x201c;So you had your first divorce. That just means you a man now. Which kind was it? She stop loving you, or you stop loving her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t like that,&#x201d; I tell him. Sirleaf grips me closer.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh hell no. I hope it wasn&#x2019;t one of those where you both still love each other, but it&#x2019;s broke anyway. Those are the worst. My first, fourth marriages, they were like that. At least you didn&#x2019;t have any kids with her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uncle Sirleaf, I really don&#x2019;t want to talk about&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t give me that &#x2018;uncle&#x2019; mess. You&#x2019;re too old for that shit. And I&#x2019;m way too young,&#x201d; he says, pushing me back for another look before pulling me in once more. &#x201c;Your pop was waiting for you to come home, you know that? This house, it was going to be for you. You and your wife, your children. Bring you back to the community.&#x201d; Sirleaf&#x2019;s voice cracks with emotion. It makes me feel guilty for wanting to break free of his musky grasp. &#x201c;And it did. You got to give that crazy honky that.&#x201d;<br><br>I look over Sirleaf&#x2019;s shoulder: there&#x2019;s a rusty Folgers Coffee can sitting on the porch, by the wall. It&#x2019;s there because my dad never smoked in a house. This can of ashes is full of cheap cigar butts, mixed with the cigarette butts of whoever visited. I know without looking inside it, because there was always a can like that on the porch of wherever my dad was living.<br><br>&#x201c;He knew I wasn&#x2019;t coming back. He was just going to fix it up to sell it, like he always did.&#x201d; This gets him to release me, partially. He still holds my shoulders, pushes me back as far as he can to take a look at my face.<br><br>&#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t his fault you ran off, was it? My daddy left me when I was four and gave me nothing but my stunning Yoruba features. So stop bitching.&#x201d;<br><br>Sirleaf is a lawyer, a realtor, a griot, and a kook, and he&#x2019;s good at all of those things. My dad was his white friend, because they had the kook thing in common. For three decades, they would get together to sell a property or drink whiskey and get kooky together. My dad had his own realtor&#x2019;s license, but he wasn&#x2019;t good with most types of humans. Sirleaf is the people&#x2019;s man, knows everyone that matters in Germantown, from councilmen to people looking to buy their first homes. He speaks three languages: Street, Caucasian, and Brotherman.<br><br>Sirleaf&#x2019;s getting old and finally he looks it. Some people age, and some just dehydrate. Sirleaf looks like someone let the water out and the creases dried in its absence. I can&#x2019;t imagine how old my dad must have looked. They were the same age but my father was one of those pasty Irish people with no melanin to protect his skin from time. He could barely manage enough pigment for a mole.<br><br>&#x201c;We should really have a funeral,&#x201d; I tell him. &#x201c;Or a memorial or&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He ain&#x2019;t want one, and we&#x2019;re going to respect that. You know your pop&#x2014;he wasn&#x2019;t one to spend good money on a bunch of bullshit. His legacy, it&#x2019;s this house, this property. And it&#x2019;s you. Now let&#x2019;s look at your inheritance.&#x201d;<br><br>With great flourish, Sirleaf turns back to open the front door. But it&#x2019;s stuck. The wood&#x2019;s swelled and it takes a lot to jar, a lot of effort to protect so little. Hell&#x2019;s lobby waits on the other side. If my father&#x2019;s soul is left in the physical world, it&#x2019;s in the tools he left behind. Sandpaper, ladders, and scaffolding. Plaster and tarps, rollers and paint tins. At the back of my nose I can smell the Old Spice and Prell even though he hadn&#x2019;t used either since I was eleven. I will be buried here too, I just know, and then I fight that thought with the words I have been thinking in the days leading up to this moment: paint and polish. Paint it, polish the wood floors, tidy up whatever basic visual problems might get in the way of a buyer&#x2019;s imagination. Build on whatever my father managed in the months since he&#x2019;d taken ownership. Use all the tricks he taught me. That&#x2019;s what I thought, packing to come back Stateside; that&#x2019;s what I thought waiting for the plane. That&#x2019;s what I tell myself now. Paint and polish. I even say it out loud.<br><br>&#x201c;There ain&#x2019;t no roof,&#x201d; Sirleaf says back to me. &#x201c;Go on, take a look at that jawn. That shit&#x2019;s crazy. The wiring in here is, like, seventy years old. And exposed&#x2014;I seen that old fuse box in the back pop sparks twice in the last hour. It&#x2019;s a miracle he didn&#x2019;t burn the place down running his power tools. I don&#x2019;t know how your pops lived up in this mess. Craig was one cheap bastard. No offense,&#x201d; and he wags his head at the shame of it.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t remind him about a childhood camped out in many a shelled home. My dad had been doing the same thing since my mother kicked him out, and that was twenty-seven years ago. I don&#x2019;t tell him about pissing in paint buckets and dumping it out the window.<br><br>&#x201c;You sure you want to sleep here? I mean, what about Tosha&#x2019;s? They still in the house I sold them. Six bedrooms. Maybe you could stay there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stop by, but I doubt her husband wants me under the same roof for an extended period.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Up to you, but I&#x2019;m out of here. This place creeps me out. You better see what you&#x2019;re dealing with on the second floor, before it gets dark. Power&#x2019;s iffy up there.&#x201d; He points to the stairs. I get the message that he wants me to go up. I also get the message that he&#x2019;s afraid to. That at least he understands the limits of his age. As he leaves, Sirleaf stares at his feet with every step, as if he&#x2019;s worried the old beams might give out on him.<br><br>&#x201c;How soon can you get it listed?&#x201d; I ask. He sighs. I&#x2019;ve missed something.<br><br>&#x201c;I told you. You can&#x2019;t sell this place the way it is, not without taking a huge loss. You can&#x2019;t sell it for the land; it&#x2019;s historic so it&#x2019;s hard to get permission to build on it. You going to have to pick up where your pop left off, and it&#x2019;s going to take a while to get it together. At least, the basics. You got shoes to fill, boy,&#x201d; he tells me. I just happen to look down when Sirleaf says it. His shoes have at least two-inch heels on them. He catches me staring and says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m engaged to this new jawn: young sister. She likes me tall.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sirleaf, look: I just got divorced. My comic-book shop, I had to sell it. I owe my ex half of that, but I&#x2019;m still living off the money. Whatever we got to do, whatever we can get, let&#x2019;s just get it soon, okay? I don&#x2019;t care if we take a loss, I just want out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. Sure. Right. You seeing the same house I&#x2019;m seeing, are you not? I mean, take a look around,&#x201d; he implores me. I don&#x2019;t need to do that.<br><br>&#x201c;My ex is a lawyer. A really, really, good one. And she&#x2019;ll sue the living shit out of me if I don&#x2019;t pay back the money I owe her. I&#x2019;m already late on the payments. You read my emails, right? I need that cash, man.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your ex isn&#x2019;t an American citizen, so she can&#x2019;t sue you here. I&#x2019;m telling you, Warren, it might seem like a big deal to get sued, but that ain&#x2019;t your major problem right now. You got other things to worry about,&#x201d; and he lifts a mudcloth-adorned arm and motions in a slow sweep around the whole damned building.<br><br>Sirleaf is right: there is no roof. There are walls. It has floors. Just no real top. In my book, that barely qualifies it as a house, makes it more of a massive cup. I brave the stairs, shining a flashlight above me as I pace the hall of the second story. In most parts of the ceiling, there&#x2019;s nothing but blue tarp separating the interior from the elements. There are a few charcoaled beams in those rooms where my father hadn&#x2019;t knocked the remains of the fire damage down. In the master bedroom, there&#x2019;s a green canvas tent, the old Coleman tent my dad used when he took me on trips to the Pine Barrens and the Appalachian Trail. Now its yellow plastic spikes are nailed directly into the blackened, fire-ravaged hardwood. Instead of camping out in the room of the house least damaged, as I would have done, as any normal person would have done, my father took up residence in a room that looks like a hollowed out piece of charcoal. There&#x2019;s a tarp on the floor to match the one glimpsed through the burnt shingles above, but besides that, the space is nearly unprotected to the heavens. It&#x2019;s the nineteenth of August, about 80 degrees outside and 90 in this room. The windows up here are covered with brown paper, taped to the glass, but the sun&#x2019;s heat gets in anyway. This is the place he grew sick in. Made the decision to not go to the doctor in. Then died in. Quietly, of pneumonia. I always assumed he would die on the streets of Germantown itself, loud. Knocked over the head for being the wrong race in the wrong neighborhood in the wrong century.<br><br>In the gloom, I drag everything&#x2014;the foldout table and chair, the lamp connected to the car battery, the propane grill, the five-gallon jugs of water, and eventually the tent itself&#x2014;one by one downstairs to the dining hall, the least damaged room in the whole house. My father managed new drywall in here, matched and replaced sections of the crown molding, and had gotten as far as laying out cans of primer for painting. With the sliding doors to the hall closed, the room almost seems habitable.</p><h2>Three Alexander Calders: A Family Memoir</h2><p>This memoir was written about America&#39;s greatest artist, Alexander Calder, and his whole family of artists by his only sibling, Margaret Calder Hayes. This is a touching and enriching story of how artistic talent was encouraged and fostered within the Calder family. &#34;Peggy&#34; Hayes wrote this book while in her &#39;80&#39;s. She reflects on the important aspects of her life with brother Sandy, her father, Alexander Sterling Calder and mother Nanette Lederer Calder (a talented artist in her own right) and her grandfather, Alexander Milne Calder. As an octogenarian, her perspective is expecially valuable.</p><p>Margaret Calder Hayes was born in Paris, France in 1896 and died in Berkeley, California in 1988. Her life story is told in her well written family memoir, Three Alexander Calders. She married Kenneth Hayes, raised two sons, Calder and Kenneth, and was active in many community endeavors throughout California. She was instrumental in the development of the UC Berkeley Art Museum and conducted art classes for children in her home for some 18 years.A marvelous &amp; timely memoir on important family values and artistry. -- <i>From the Publisher</i></p><h2>Ten Mile Day and the Building of the Transcontinental Railroad</h2><p>Challenged to lay a full ten miles of railroad track in one day in exchange for four times their wages, the Chinese men working on America&#39;s first continental railroad in 1869 face their greatest challenge yet.</p><p><b>Mary Ann Fraser </b>has illustrated more than forty books for children, and is the author-illustrator of a growing list of popular middle-grade books that focus on U.S. history. Her <i>In Search of the Grand Canyon</i> was voted a Best Book of the Year by <i>School Library Journal</i> and <i>Ten Mile Day</i> was an <i>American Bookseller</i> Pick, of the Lists. A graduate of Exter College of Art Design, she lives with her husband and three children in Simi Valley, California.Grade 4-6-- The day that 10 miles of railroad track were laid on the Union Pacific end of the transcontinental railroad was indeed a remarkable one for laborers, suppliers, and organizers. It was never duplicated. Other historians mention this achievement, but Fraser captures the action in brilliantly rendered oils. Her laborers look like workers--not just men standing around. In a few useful sidebars and in informative endpapers, she adds details that enlarge upon and enhance the text. For the full history of 19th-century railroad building--with its problems, politics, people--read Leonard Everett Fisher's Tracks Across America (Holiday, 1992).

In the attic of their old family palazzo on the Grand Canal, his father had found the love letters of their ancestor Andrea Memmo, one of the last great Venetian statesmen, to a beautiful half-English girl named Giustiniana Wynne. Some of the letters were written in code, which di Robilant and his father cracked to reveal an illicit passion: Giustiniana was not of the elite ruling class and would never have been considered a suitable match for Andrea. But their acts of devotion were startlingly brazen. As their courtship unfolds, they plot elaborate marriage schemes that offend everyone, arrange secret trysts in borrowed rooms, cause trouble for the servants who must ferry their forbidden correspondence, and even weather an unwanted pregnancy, from which Giustiniana, with her wits and ingenuity and some crucial assistance from the infamous Casanova, emerges unscathed.<br><br>Andrea di Robilant, heir to the lovers&#x2019; legacy, captures them in the twilight of the golden era of Venice, with forays to the colorful social circles of London and Paris along the way. His sparkling, well-paced narrative evokes the world of mask-wearing men and ladies attending Goldoni plays and gambling at the Ridotto&#x2014;bringing to life, 250 years later, a tale of unbounded passion and rich historical intrigue.</p><p>It's hard to imagine a more romantic real-life story than the long, forbidden love affair of the 18th-century Venetian nobleman Andrea Memmo and a half-English beauty named Giustiniana Wynne. Andrea Di Robilant's <i>A Venetian Affair</i> is drawn in part from a cache of letters discovered by the author's father in his ancestral <i>palazzo</i> on the Grand Canal. In 1753, his ancestor Andrea Memmo had been introduced to a lovely girl of uncertain station (illegitimate, although her parents later married). The Wynnes's position was precarious enough in Venice's rigid society, and Giustiniana's mother took every step to prevent the young aristocrat from corrupting her daughter. But the two lovers began to meet in secret: exchanging letters through confederates and communicating in public through an elaborate code of nods and gestures. They even came within a few days of being married before further dark revelations about Giustiniana's family put a permanent end to their hopes. Although Memmo went on to have an illustrious career in the dying Venetian Republic, it is Giustiniana's astonishing later life that really captures the reader. <i>A Venetian Affair</i> provides both a rich picture of the times--including cameo appearances by that scamp, Casanova--and a convincing account of an enduring passion. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Andrea di Robilant was born in Italy and educated at Le Rosey and Columbia University, where he specialized in international affairs.

When word comes that a single page of the book, covered in lines pulsing with dark energy, survived Brin's magic, Jair must take up the fight alone. But Jair's gift is not the equal of his sister's, and as he steals into the prison fortress of Dun Fee Aran--where he almost died in his first foray against the Ildatch--he has nothing to rely upon but the power of illusion.

His friend Hastings arrives as a guest at her home. When the woman is killed, Poirot uses his detective skills to solve the mystery. The first book of the &#34;Hercule Poirot&#34; series, The Mysterious Affair at Styles is a masterpiece of mystery and a must-have for all who love a great story!</p><p>Here is the famous first case that launched the legendary career of Hercule Poirot and his ingenious creator Agatha Christie, now the most popular mystery writer of all time, as well as the world's best-selling author (over two billion copies of her books are in print). With The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Agatha Christie's cerebral and eccentric Belgian detective steps out of retirement and into the limelight of a classic mystery.<p>Styles Court is a magnificent English manor house owned by a rich, strong-willed matron who, to the dismay of her stepson, has recently married a fortune hunter. The scene is set for death by violence. The murder of the mistress of Styles Court is so baffling, so cleverly-plotted, that it challenges even the skill of Hercule Poirot, notwithstanding the legions of tiny gray cells that take residence in his ever-so-fertile mind.</p>Who poisoned the wealthy Emily Inglethorpe, and how did the murderer penetrate and escape from her locked bedroom? Sus-pects abound in the quaint village of Styles St. Mary--from the heiress's fawning new husband to her two stepsons, her volatile housekeeper, and a pretty nurse who works in a hospital dispensary. Making his unforgettable debut, the brilliant Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is on the case. <br>"The key to the success of this style of detective novel," writes Elizabeth George in her Introduction, "lies in how the author deals with both the clues and the red herrings, and it has to be said that no one bettered Agatha Christie at this game."</p><h2>Vibrant Quilt Collage: A Spontaneous Approach to Fused Art Quilts</h2><p><p>Explore this groundbreaking book that shows quilters how to create unique and expressive quilts by going beyond conventional patchwork using improvisational collage techniques and fusing.</p><p>Author Bethan Ash, known for her rich and colorful quilt designs, shows how to use hand and machine stitching as a final embellishment to the quilted piece.

To arrive at the answers to this far-reaching question, one of our foremost medieval historians, Miri Rubin, investigates the ideas, practices, and images that have developed around the figure of Mary from the earliest decades of Christianity to around the year 1600. Drawing on an extraordinarily wide range of sources&#x2014;including music, poetry, theology, art, scripture, and miracle tales&#x2014;Rubin reveals how Mary became so embedded in our culture that it is impossible to conceive of Western history without her.</p><p>In her rise to global prominence, Mary was continually remade and reimagined by wave after wave of devotees. Rubin shows how early Christians endowed Mary with a fine ancestry; why in early medieval Europe her roles as mother, bride, and companion came to the fore; and how the focus later shifted to her humanity and unparalleled purity.

In this breakthrough study, the preeminent war historian John Keegan goes to the heart of a series of important conflicts to develop a powerful argument about military intelligence. <br><br>In his characteristically wry and perceptive prose, Keegan offers us nothing short of a new history of war through the prism of intelligence. He brings to life the split-second decisions that went into waging war before the benefit of aerial surveillance and electronic communications. The English admiral Horatio Nelson was hot on the heels of Napoleon&#x2019;s fleet in the Mediterranean and never knew it, while Stonewall Jackson was able to compensate for the Confederacy&#x2019;s disadvantage in firearms and manpower with detailed maps of the Appalachians. In the past century, espionage and decryption have changed the face of battle: the Japanese surprise attack at the Battle of the Midway was thwarted by an early warning. Timely information, however, is only the beginning of the surprising and disturbing aspects of decisions that are made in war, where brute force is often more critical.<br><br><i>Intelligence in War</i> is a thought-provoking work that ranks among John Keegan&#x2019;s finest achievements.</p><p>John Keegan&#x2019;s books include <i>The First World War, The Battle for History, The Face of Battle, War and Our World, The Mask of Command, Fields of Battle</i> and A<i> History of Warfare</i>.

He lives in Wiltshire, England.Knowledge of the Enemy<br>Strategic Intelligence<br><br>"No war can be conducted successfully without early and good intelligence,&#x201d; wrote the great Duke of Marlborough. George Washington agreed: &#x201c;The necessity of procuring good intelligence is apparent and need not be further argued.&#x201d; No sensible soldier or sailor or airman does argue. From the earliest times, military leaders have always sought information of the enemy, his strengths, his weaknesses, his intentions, his dispositions. Alexander the Great, presiding at the Macedonian court as a boy while his father, Philip, was absent on campaign, was remembered by visitors from the lands he would later conquer for his persistence in questioning them about the size of the population of their territory, the productiveness of the soil, the course of the routes and rivers that crossed it, the location of its towns, harbours and strong places, the identity of the important men. The young Alexander was assembling what today would be called economic, regional or strategic intelligence, and the knowledge he accumulated served him well when he began his invasion of the Persian empire, enormous in extent and widely diverse in composition. Alexander triumphed because he brought to his battlefields a ferocious fighting force of tribal warriors personally devoted to the Macedonian monarchy; but he also picked the Persian empire to pieces, attacking at its weak points and exploiting its internal divisions.<br><br>The strategy of divide and conquer, usually based on regional intelligence, underlay many of the greatest exploits of empire building. Not all; the Mongols preferred terror, counting on the word of their approach to dissolve resistance. If duplicity enhanced their terrible reputation, so much the better. In 1258, appearing out of the desert, Hulagu promised the Caliph, spiritual leader of Islam, ruler of the Muslim empire, his life if he would surrender Baghdad. As soon as he submitted, he was strangled and the horde moved on. The Mongols, however, as a wide-ranging nomad people, also knew a great deal and, like all nomads, when not on campaign, were always ready to trade. Markets are principal centres for the exchange of information as well as goods, and it was often a demand of marauders&#x2014;by the Huns of the Romans, frequently by the Vikings&#x2014;that they should be allowed to set up markets on the borders of settled lands. Commerce was commonly the prelude to predation. Trade may follow the flag, as the Victorians comfortably affirmed, but it was quite as often the other way about.<br><br>Empires in the ascendant, to whom nomads were an irritation rather than a threat, adopted a different attitude. They gave and withheld permission to trade and hold markets on their borders as a deliberate means of local control.1 They also pursued active &#x201c;forward&#x201d; policies. The pharaohs of the Twelfth Dynasty not only constructed a deep belt of forts on the border between settled Egypt and Nubia but also created a frontier force and issued it with standing orders. Its duty was to prevent Nubian incursions into the Nile Valley but also to patrol into the desert and report. One report, preserved on papyrus at Thebes, reads, &#x201c;We have found the track of 32 men and 3 donkeys&#x201d;; nearly 4,000 years old, it might have been written yesterday.<br><br>Ancient Egypt&#x2019;s border problem was perfectly manageable. The narrowness of the Nile Valley, amid the surrounding desert, necessitated the minimum of protective measures. The Roman empire, by contrast, was encircled on all sides by enemies, who might come by sea as well as land, and needed to be defended by elaborate fixed fortifications as well as mobile armies. At the height of their power, Rome&#x2019;s rulers preferred active to passive defence and maintained strong striking forces at strategic points generally behind rather than on the frontiers. It was only as their power declined and that of the outsiders grew that the border defences were thickened.<br><br>Whether on the decline or in the ascendant, Rome devoted great care to the gathering of intelligence. Caesar&#x2019;s conquest of Gaul was as much the result of his superior use of intelligence as the legions&#x2019; superior fighting power. He took great trouble to assemble economic and regional intelligence, just as Alexander had done, and he was a coldly cynical assessor of the Gauls&#x2019; ethnic defects, their boastfulness, volatility, unreliability, lack of resilience; he was equally cold in exploiting the advantage his knowledge of their weaknesses afforded. He accumulated a detailed ethnographic knowledge of their tribal characteristics and divisions, which he used ruthlessly to defeat them. Quite apart from this strategic intelligence, however, he also had a highly developed system of tactical intelligence, using short- and medium-range units of scouts to reconnoitre in advance of his main body, to spy out the land and the enemy&#x2019;s dispositions when he proceeded on campaign. It was an important principle that the leaders of these units had immediate and direct access to his person.<br><br>Caesar did not invent the Roman system of intelligence. It was the product of several hundred years of military experience. Evidence for that is already given, by the time of the Gallic wars (first century b.c.), by the existence of established terms for the different categories of reconnaissance troops: procursatores, who performed close reconnaissance immediately ahead of the army; exploratores, longer-range scouts; and speculatores, who spied deeper within enemy territory. The Roman army also made use of local informers (indices), prisoners of war, deserters and kidnapped civilians.2 If not the inventor of the system, Caesar may, nevertheless, be credited with professionalising it and institutionalising some of its most important features, notably the right of direct access by scouts to the commander in person. He also, when necessary, went to see for himself, a dangerous but sometimes essential intervention. Ultimately, the crisis of the empire in the fourth century required the almost continuous presence of one of the emperors (there were latterly two, sometimes more) with the army, a contingency that, at Adrianople in 378, led to his death on the field, progressive disaster and the empire&#x2019;s collapse. The emperor Valens had been in close touch with his exploratores on the morning of the catastrophe, and they had correctly reported the enemy&#x2019;s strength and dispositions. What ensued substantiates a profound and enduring truth, that &#x201c;military and political survival does not depend solely on good intelligence.&#x201d;3<br><br>Systems do not, however, much change, unless circumstances change, and there was little circumstantial change throughout the five centuries of the Roman Empire&#x2019;s greatness (first century b.c.&#x2013;fourth century a.d.). Reconnaissance throughout the period was by hearing and sight, communication by word of mouth or written despatch, speed of transmission at fastest by that of a fleet-footed horse. What was true of Rome remained true of the world for another 1,500 years.<br><br>The collapse of imperial government in the West in the fifth cen-tury a.d. entailed also the collapse of organised intelligence services and such ancillary services as the publication of guidebooks and cartography (though Roman maps are strange to us, since they usually took the form of route-charts rather than two-dimensional displays of territorial features, their disappearance was a serious loss to campaigning commanders). Worse by far were the progressive degradation and eventual and complete decay of the road system. The Roman roads were built primarily for the purpose of rapid all-weather military movement and were maintained by the legions, which were as much engineering as fighting units. The dissolution of the Roman army led rapidly to the cessation of engineering work on such key elements of the Roman transport system as bridges and fords. The road network, of course, had not existed during the period of Roman conquest; Caesar had made his way through Gaul by interrogating merchants and locals and impressing guides. It was the roads, however, that had allowed Rome to defend its empire for five centuries and the break-up of their solid surfaces made long-range campaigning at speed impossible.<br><br>That was not important to the barbarian rulers who succeeded the Romans, since they sought no more than to maintain local authority. When, however, the attempt began again, under the Carolingian emperors, to reestablish wide imperial domains in the eighth and ninth centuries, the absence of roads was a serious impediment to reconquest. Things got even worse with the attempt to penetrate the Germanic regions which lay beyond the old Roman borders. In those wildernesses there were neither roads nor easily obtainable intelligence.<br><br>Some picture of the difficulties confronting medieval campaigners is conveyed by the experience of the Teutonic Knights in their effort to conquer and Christianise the Baltic shore in the fourteenth century. The Teutonic Knights, a crusading order dedicated to the conversion of the Prussians and Lithuanians, were wealthy and highly organised. They operated from a chain of strong castles built on the Baltic coast, in which they were secure from attack and could organise crusading expeditions into the hinterland. One of their principal campaigning grounds was a belt of unsettled land a hundred miles wide between East Prussia and Lithuania proper, a maze of marsh, lakes, small rivers, thickets and forest through which it was almost impossible to find a way. Local scouts were recruited by the Knights to blaze trails and report. Their intelligence was collected in a military guidebook, Die Lithauischen Wegeberichte (The Lithuanian Route Guide), compiled between 1384 and 1402. It explains, for example, that Knights wishing to get to Vandziogala from Samogitia, both near modern Kaunas in Lithuania, a distance of about thirty-five miles by today&#x2019;s roads, had first to cross a patch of scrub, by a track, then a large ...</p><h2>The Legendary Artists of Taos</h2><p>Briefly surveys the lives and careers of members of the Taos art colony, most of whom were trained in Europe, but who were drawn to the beauty and the Spanish and Indian heritage of New Mexico</p><p></p><h2>The Nature of Prejudice</h2><p>earlier version of Allport&#39;s book</p><p>&#39;The Nature of Prejudice&#39; remains the standard work on discrimination.

Clothed in a dirty, ragged gown, he tramped through the narrow, crooked streets of the city. As he walked, his white hair and flowing white beard reflected the morning rays of the sun. Although it was broad daylight, he carried a lighted lantern as he doggedly plodded through the streets, jostling his way through the milling crowds. <p>Making his way to the noisy, crowded marketplace, he approached one man after another, holding his lantern up to their faces, and scrutinizing every line of their countenances. Amid the clatter of horses and the shouts of vendors hawking their wares, onlookers stared curiously at this crazed eccentric. </p><p>"What are you doing, you madman?" someone shouted sarcastically from the throngs. </p><p>"My name is Diogenes," he replied testily, "and I'm searching for an honest man." </p><p>If Diogenes carried his lantern into today's churches, would he find an honest man or woman? The reason I ask is that this is primarily a book about honesty. By the term "honesty," I'm not referring to restraint from stealing or lying. Rather, I'm speaking of intellectual and spiritual honesty. That is, the willingness to be totally objective in the pursuit of God's truth. Intellectually honest Christians have the desire and the ability to see all sides of any spiritual or theological issue. They are far more concerned about finding out what is true than they are about defending their personal positions or the positions of their denomination or church.</p></p><h2>Anathem</h2><p><p> For ten years Fraa Erasmas, a young avout, has lived in a cloistered sanctuary for mathematicians, scientists, and philosophers, protected from the corrupting influences of the outside world.

Just over 6,800 of those men died in battle. About 25,000 became prisoners of war, most of them confined in New York City under conditions so atrocious that they perished by the thousands. Evidence suggests that at least 17,500 Americans may have died in these prisons&#x2014;more than twice the number to die on the battlefield. It was in New York, not Boston or Philadelphia, where most Americans gave their lives for the cause of independence.<p>New York City became the jailhouse of the American Revolution because it was the principal base of the Crown's military operations. Beginning with the bumper crop of American captives taken during the 1776 invasion of New York, captured Americans were stuffed into a hastily assembled collection of public buildings, sugar houses, and prison ships. The prisoners were shockingly overcrowded and chronically underfed&#x2014;those who escaped alive told of comrades so hungry they ate their own clothes and shoes.</p><p>Despite the extraordinary number of lives lost, <i>Forgotten Patriots</i> is the first-ever account of what took place in these hell-holes.

The heat was unbearable, malaria would be a constant danger, her husband would have to be away for long stretches, there were no schools or nearby doctors for their three daughters, and of course the area teemed with wild animals. Yet for Kobie and her family, the seventeen years at South Africa's Kruger National Park were the most magical of their lives. Now, in The Wilderness Family, Kobie recounts the enchanting adventures and extraordinary encounters they experienced in this vast reserve where wildlife has right of way.<br><br>Kobie and her husband Kobus were overwhelmed by the beauty of the Mahlangeni ranger station when they arrived with their little girls in the autumn of 1980. Golden sunshine glowed in the lush garden where fruit bats hung in the sausage trees; hippos basked in the glittering waters of the Letaba River; storks and herons perched along the shore. Kobie felt she had found heaven on earth--until she awoke that first night to find a python slithering silently across her bedroom floor. It was the perfect introduction to the wonders and terrors that awaited her.<br><br>As the Kr�gers settled in, they became accustomed to living in the midst of ravishing splendor and daily surprises. A honey badger they nursed back to health rampaged affectionately through the house. Sneaky hyenas stole blankets and cook pots. Ordinarily placid elephants grew foul-tempered and violent in the summer heat. And one terrible day, the shadow of tragedy fell across the family when a lion attacked Kobus in the bush and nearly killed him.<br><br>But nothing prepared the Kr�gers for the adventure of raising an orphaned lion cub. The cub was only a few days old and on the verge of death when they found him alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo, as the girls promptly named the cub, survived on loads of love and bottles of fat-enriched milk, and soon became an affectionate, rambunctious member of the family. At the heart of the book, Kobie recounts the unique bond that each of the Kr�gers forged with Leo and their sometimes hilarious endeavor to teach him to become a "real" lion and live with his own kind in the wild.<br><br>Writing with deep affection and luminous prose, Kobie Kr�ger captures here the mystery of untamed Africa--its fathomless skies, soulful landscapes, and most of all, its astonishing array of animals. By turns funny and <br>heart-breaking, engaging and suspenseful, The Wilderness Family is an unforgettable memoir of a woman, her family, and the amazing game reserve they called home for seventeen incredible years.</p><p>Longtime animal lover Kobie Kr�ger got a little more than she bargained for when she married a game warden and moved deep into some of South Africa's wildest country.<p> In <i>The Wilderness Family</i>, Kr�ger recounts adventures and misadventures with the curious menagerie that shared her turf--and sometimes her roof--in the remote Mahlangeni section of Kruger National Park, which lies in the river-laced country between South Africa and Mozambique. Among the animals she encounters in the pages of her memoir are enterprising hyenas who, for whatever reason, pilfer cookware and blankets; a python that crept into bed with the Kr�gers on their first night in Mahlangeni; Egyptian goslings raised by a proud but broad-minded bantam hen; and the occasional ill-tempered elephant. Most affecting of all her encounters, however, is her long association with an orphaned lion cub named Leo, whom she and her family raised into adulthood. Leo, whose pastimes included alarming unsuspecting visitors and staring at passing birds in the sky, takes center stage for much of this book, and Kr�ger's loving portrait is a warm rejoinder to Joy Adamson's <i>Born Free</i>.</p><p> Readers who come to this memorable study of life in the African outback will be duly entertained, and those who are planning a trip there will learn a thing or two about how to behave around genets, cobras, rhinos--and, yes, lions. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>&#x201c;Fascinating&#x2026; <i>The Wilderness Family</i>&#x2026;is a highly engaging work because of its wealth of detail about the creatures, plants, landscape and rhythms of Africa.

He lives in Monument, Colorado, with his wife, Judy, and their four children, Gretchen, Kelly, Rachel, and Stephen. He is the author of several books, including Windows of the Soul and Moments with the SaviorIncredible Moments with the Savior takes you on a devotional journey that begins at a festive wedding in Cana, where Jesus worked his first miracle. That journey ends in the torch-lit Garden of Gethsemane, where he performed his last. Along the way you will catch fleeting glimpses of what the saints of old longed to see--the glory of the promised Messiah. You will see this glory poured out not upon prophets or priests or Pharisees, but rather upon the most unlikely of recipients -- the burdened, the bewildered, and the bereaved. You will see these weary and heavy-laden people fall at Jesus&#39; feet. And you will see him stoop to gently uncinch the heavy loads that life has strapped on their backs. As you walk past these tender moments of mercy, you will step lightly, reverently . . . for they are sacred ground. There you will see the veil of heaven lifted. There you will see the glory of God revealed. And there you will take off your shoes . . . fall on your knees . . . and worship a truly incredible Savior. Incredible Moments with the Savior is the second in a series of four devotional books on the life of Christ. The first was Intimate Moments with the Savior. The first book captured the intimate, life-changing moments that people encountered with Jesus. This one captures the incredible moments that revealed his deity and compassion. While Intimate moments cultivated devotional prayer, Incredible Moments cultivates intercessory prayer. It takes you beyond your own needs to focus on the needs of others. It forms a stepping stone that takes you a little bit closer to the heart of God.</p><h2>The Hymnal for Worship &amp; Celebration KJV</h2><p>For Keyboard/Rhythm. This edition: Rhythm Book 15.

Just nine years old and on the verge of becoming one of the sultan's hundreds of wives, Sara's story takes an unexpected turn when she is recognized by Bertha, the slave in charge of training Njoya's brides, as Nebu, the son she lost tragically years before. In Sara's new life as a boy she bears witness to the world of Sultan Njoya--a magical yet declining place of artistic and intellectual minds--and hears the story of the sultan's last days in the Palace of All Dreams and of the sad fate of Nebu, the greatest artist their culture had seen.</p><p> Seven decades later, a student returns home to Cameroon to research the place it once was, and she finds Sara, silent for decades, ready to tell her story. In her serpentine tale, a lost kingdom lives again in the compromised intersection between flawed memory, tangled fiction, and faintly discernible truth. In this telling, history is invented anew and transformed--a man awakens from a coma to find the animal kingdom dancing a waltz; a spirit haunts a cocoa plantation; and a sculptor re-creates his lost love in a work of art that challenges the boundary between truth and the ideal. The award-winning novelist Patrice Nganang's lyrical and majestic <i>Mount Pleasant</i> is a resurrection of the world of early-twentieth-century Cameroon and an elegy for the men and women swept up in the forces of colonization.</p></p><p><b>Patrice Nganang</b> was born in Cameroon and is a novelist, a poet, and an essayist.

He teaches comparative literature at Stony Brook University.<p>"Patrice Nganang&#x2019;s dazzling novel [stands] in a league of its own, so different from the great majority of novels by African writers in the past fifty or sixty years."&#x2015;Charles R. Larson, <i>Counterpunch</i></p><p>"Cameroonian writer Nganang delivers a modern epic, tinged with liberal doses of magical realism, of life in his country's colonial era . . .

He's powerless to do anything about it--until one day he faces several of the killers and exacts a chilling penance.&nbsp;&nbsp;But is Terry Dunn really a priest?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He doesn't always appear to act like one. He comes home to Detroit and runs into Debbie Dewey who's doing standup at a comedy club. In her set, Debbie tells what it was like in prison, down for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Terry and Debie hit it off; they have the same sense of humor and similar goals in that both are out to raise money. Terry says for the Little Orphans of Rwanda; Debbie to score off a guy who conned her out of sixty-seven thousand dollars. This is Randy, now wealthy, who runs a fashionable restaurant and is connected to the Detroit Mafia.<br><br>It's Debbie who keeps prying until she learns the bizarre truth about Terry; Debbie who sells him on going in together for a much bigger payoff than either could manage alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened in Rwanda remains alive through the unexpected twists and turns of the plot. But even with this tragic background. <b>Pagan Babies</b> comes off as Leonard's funniest straight-faced novel to date.</p><p>After 30-odd novels, one might think that Elmore Leonard has nothing left to prove. But <i>Pagan Babies</i>, a novel filled with his signatures (tight plotting, scathing wit, and that grittily realistic dialogue), shows once again why he sets the standard against which other crime novels are measured. In fact, Leonard has raised the bar. How many authors would dare use the Rwandan genocide as backdrop for a story that moves gaily between romantic comedy and a massive, labyrinthine con? More to the point, how many of them would pull it off? <p> Father Terry Dunn doesn't have qualms about substituting punishment for penance. If that means killing four Hutu murderers who slaughtered his Tutsi congregation, so be it. Being an instrument of divine wrath has certain disadvantages, however, so Dunn breaks camp and heads for Detroit, where he's welcomed by family, a five-year-old federal indictment for tax fraud, and a fast-talking fireball named Debbie Dewey. Fresh from a stint in prison for assaulting her former fianc�, Randy, with a Ford Escort, Debbie is out for revenge: </p><blockquote>"I still can't believe I fell for it. He tells me he's retired from Merrill Lynch, one of their top traders, and I believed him. Did I check? No, not till it was too late. But you know what did me in, besides the hair and the tan? Greed. He said if I had a savings account that wasn't doing much and would like to put it to work... He shows me his phony portfolio, stock worth millions, and like a dummy I said, 'Well, I've got fifty grand not doing too much.' I signed it over and that's the last I saw of my money."</blockquote> It's only a matter of time before Debbie's desire for cold, hard cash and Dunn's fundraising for Rwandan orphans join forces in a carefully plotted financial assault on Randy's benefactor, Tony Amilia, who just happens to be the last of the old-school Detroit Mafia. Throw in a couple of hit men to whom <i>loyalty</i> is a foreign word, and you've got vintage Leonard: a fast-paced, roller-coaster ride of a novel where <i>deceiver</i> and <i>deceived</i> are gloriously shifty signifiers. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i>5 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Structure of Complex Words</h2><p><p> Empson's classic may "have even more to teach us about language now than It did In 1951. when this remarkable book was first published," writes Jonathan Cutler in his valuable foreword. Empson elegantly demonstrates the weight of allusion and Implication borne by even the simplest words of our language: man, honest, quite, dog. he explores the complex play of such words in social situations and in literature, producing in the process brilliant critical essays--on sense in Wordsworth's <i>Prelude, honest</i> in <i>Othello</i> and <i>King Lear</i> all in <i>Paradise Lost</i>--which go straight to the heart of the matter. </p><p> Lively and irreverent, this book offers persuasive accounts of the structure of metaphor, the statements carried by words, and the failure of dictionary entries to capture the most pertinent aspects of the structure and meaning of words. Culler writes that It stakes out "a new position in debates about meaning and context about the literary in Its relation to the social and the historical. Empson's brilliant discussions of words which express complex social attitudes toward one's fellows or toward moral principles open rich chapters of social and literary history." </p></p><p><b>Sir William Empson</b> (1906-1984) held the Chair of English Literature from 1953 to 1971 at the University of Sheffield.Mr. Empson...focuses on complex words because they are the most direct and valuable evidence for the understanding of our cultural tradition...The promise of the approach seems unbounded. The achievement is great not only in originality, insight, and entertainment, but in truth and substance. So great that Mr. Empson's right to be called the most distinguished critic of his generation can hardly now be questioned.

Nuland, M.D., is the author of nine previous books, including Doctors: The Biography of Medicine, The Wisdom of the Body, The Mysteries Within, Lost in America: A Journey with My Father, and The Doctors&#x2019; Plague. His book How We Die: Reflections on Life&#x2019;s Final Chapter won the National Book Award and spent thirty-four weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. His writing has appeared in The New Yorker, The New Republic, The New York Times, Time, and The New York Review of Books. Nuland is a clinical professor of surgery at Yale University, where he also teaches bioethics and medical history. He lives with his family in Connecticut.<br><br>Lost in America, Doctors: The Biography of Medicine, How We Live, and How We Die are available in paperback from Vintage Books.Maimonides, one of the preeminent personalities of medieval Jewish history, was a jurist, philosopher, expert in Jewish law, physician at the court of Saladin and a respected and dedicated communal leader. Given all that, it's difficult to understand the decision to present Maimonides's legacy primarily through the lens of his work as a physician. The 12th century was a time of stagnation in the history of medicine, and the author himself concedes that Maimonides contributed very little that was new or innovative to the field. By contrast, his jurisprudential <i>magnum opus</i>, the <i>Mishne Torah</i>, constituted a groundbreaking work in its own day and continues to be authoritative almost a millennium later. Although Nuland acknowledges this in a chapter on Maimonides's religious scholarship, it is dwarfed by the overarching concern with medicine&#x2014;which seems the primary interest of Nuland, a clinical professor of surgery at Yale. The author does a serviceable job of stitching together this slight, popular biography of the larger-than-life Maimonides, but his writing is marred by an overwrought prologue and some glib generalizations. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Using straightforward language, <b>One Universe</b> explores the physical principles that govern the workings of our own world so that we can appreciate how they operate in the cosmos around us. Bands of color in a sunlit crystal and the spectrum of starlight in giant telescopes, the arc of a hard-hit baseball and the orbit of the moon, traffic patterns on a freeway and the spiral arms in a galaxy full of stars--they're all tied together in grand and simple ways.</p> <p>We can understand the vast cosmos in which we live by exploring three basic concepts: motion, matter, and energy. With these as a starting point, <b>One Universe</b> shows how the physical principles that operate in our kitchens and backyards are actually down-to-Earth versions of cosmic processes. The book then takes us to the limits of our knowledge, asking the ultimate questions about the origins and existence of life as we know it and where the universe came from--and where it is going.</p> <p>Glorious photographs--many seen for the first time in these pages--and original illustrations expand and enrich our understanding. Evocative and clearly written, <b>One Universe</b> explains complex ideas in ways that every reader can grasp and enjoy. This book captures the grandeur of the heavens while making us feel at home in the cosmos. Above all, it helps us realize that galaxies, stars, planets, and we ourselves all belong to One Universe.</p> Table of Contents<br><ul><li>Front Matter</li><li>Executive Summary</li><li>1 Introduction</li><li>2 Criteria for Selection</li><li>3 Priority Areas for Quality Improvement</li><li>4 Process for Identifying Priority Areas</li><li>Appendix A: Biographies of Committee Members</li><li>Appendix B: Committee on Identifying Priority Areas for Quality Improvement Workshop</li><li>Appendix C: Priority Setting Models</li></ul></p><p>Don't let the large size and lush graphics fool you--<i>One Universe</i> is no coffee-table book. This grand tour explores the staggering vastness of space and the incomprehensibly tiny pieces that fit together to make our bodies, our planet, comets, and cosmic rays. Astrophysicists Neil de Grasse Tyson and Charles Liu of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and science journalist Robert Irion have teamed up to put a planetarium in a book, and while you'll have to provide your own choral background music, the images are sharp and beautiful and the accompanying text is clear and engaging. The authors clearly love their subject and their work and even the most casual reader will find the book as inescapable as a black hole.<p> See supernovae, eclipses, and the end of the universe in all its quiet glory--but just as your eyes are drawn to the pretty pictures, your mind will seek out the explanations and elaborations accompanying them. Tyson is well known as the director of the Hayden Planetarium and has a brilliant knack for exciting people about astronomy without condescending or diluting; in fact, his respect for the public's intelligence is one of the best features of <i>One Universe</i>.

More than half a century after their collaboration ended, Rodgers &amp; Hart songs are indispensable to the repertoire of nightclub singers everywhere. <i>A Ship Without a Sail </i>is the story of the complicated man who was Lorenz Hart. <br><br>His lyrics spin with brilliance and sophistication, yet at their core is an unmistakable wistfulness. The sweetness of &#x201c;My Romance&#x201d; and &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t It Romantic?&#x201d; is unsurpassed in American song, but Hart&#x2019;s lyrics could also be cynical, funny, ironic. He brought a unique wit and elegance to popular music. <br><br>Larry Hart and Richard Rodgers wrote approximately thirty Broadway musicals and dozens of songs for Hollywood films. At least four of their musicals&#x2014;<i>On Your Toes, Babes in Arms, The Boys from Syracuse, </i>and <i>Pal Joey</i>&#x2014; have become classics. But despite their prodigious collaboration, Rodgers and Hart were an odd couple. Rodgers was precise, punctual, heterosexual, handsome, and eager to be accepted by Society. Hart was barely five feet tall, alcoholic, homosexual, and more comfortable in a bar or restaurant than anywhere else. Terrified of solitude, he invariably threw the party and picked up the check. His lyrics are all the more remarkable considering that he never sustained a romantic relationship, living his entire life with his mother, who died only months before he died at age forty-eight. <br><br>Gary Marmorstein&#x2019;s revelatory biography includes many of the lyrics that define Hart&#x2019;s legacy&#x2014;those clever, touching stanzas that still move us or make us laugh.</p><p><b>Gary Marmorstein </b>has written about film, theater, and popular music for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>Stagebill</i>, among other publications, and is the author of two previous books.

Hart was considered by many to be the greatest of all American lyricists. Hart&#x2019;s attorney Abraham M. Wattenberg arrived with his young associate Leonard Klein, bearing an order, duly made by Surrogate James A. Foley, to open the box with the express purpose of removing Hart&#x2019;s will. A representative of the state tax commission agreed to be there at 11:45 A.M. to oversee the task. Already present were the two executors named in the will: William Kron, who had been Hart&#x2019;s accountant for the past five years; and Richard Rodgers, the composer with whom, over the course of twenty-five years, Hart had written more than eight hundred songs, including &#x201c;My Funny Valentine,&#x201d; &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t It Romantic?,&#x201d; &#x201c;My Heart Stood Still,&#x201d; &#x201c;Blue Moon,&#x201d; &#x201c;My Romance,&#x201d; &#x201c;With a Song in My Heart,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Lady Is a Tramp,&#x201d; &#x201c;Thou Swell,&#x201d; &#x201c;I Didn&#x2019;t Know What Time It Was,&#x201d; &#x201c;Mountain Greenery,&#x201d; &#x201c;Manhattan,&#x201d; &#x201c;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,&#x201d; &#x201c;I Could Write a Book,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Where or When.&#x201d;<br> <br>Expected at the bank were Hart&#x2019;s younger brother, Theodore, an actor known personally and professionally as Teddy, and Teddy&#x2019;s wife, Dorothy. Teddy had lived with Lorenz&#x2014;or Larry, as he was called&#x2014;and their mother until January 1938, when he married Dorothy Lubow and the couple moved to an apartment in the West Fifties. Never living far from Larry, the Harts often looked after him&#x2014;and few intelligent, able-bodied men have needed such looking after&#x2014;especially in the six months following the death of the boys&#x2019; mother, Frieda, in April 1943. When they arrived at Guaranty Trust, they did not know what was in the will. The others did.1<br> <br>The state tax commission representative was delayed. Teddy Hart, who had always played up his lack of book knowledge in clowning contrast to the erudition of his brother, now asked Abe Wattenberg if he had a copy of the will. Wattenberg, in fact, was carrying two copies, and he gave one to Teddy and one to Dorothy. Sitting side by side in the funereal hush of the bank, the Harts read through Larry&#x2019;s will, dated June 17 of that year. The high-ceilinged space had not always felt so sepulchral; decades earlier it had been occupied by the opulent restaurant Sherry&#x2019;s, where Charles Pierre, who later built the Hotel Pierre, was captain, and diners were serenaded by live music and the clatter of silverware and crystal.2<br> <br>&#x201c;Do either of you have any questions?&#x201d; asked Wattenberg.<br> <br>Dorothy Hart finally looked up from her copy. &#x201c;Does this mean that if I have any children, they&#x2019;re cut off?&#x201d; Yes, said Wattenberg, that&#x2019;s what it meant. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s hardly fair,&#x201d; Dorothy said. She pointed out that Larry&#x2019;s estate ought to remain in the family; given the way the will was worded, if she were to have children, they would have no share in his legacy.<br> <br>By then Teddy and Dorothy had been married for nearly six years; to Abe Wattenberg, a Hart child seemed an improbability. Nevertheless, Wattenberg assured her that the Harts would be ably supported by the $100,000 life insurance policy that Larry had left to Teddy&#x2014;more than enough to take care of the Harts and any children they might have. &#x201c;In any case,&#x201d; Wattenberg went on, &#x201c;I followed your brother&#x2019;s instructions to the letter. This is what he wanted.&#x201d; Wattenberg, a music publishing insider who over the years had represented John Philip Sousa, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, and Vincent Youmans, had been Larry Hart&#x2019;s attorney since 1925 and, as he reminded Teddy and Dorothy, every legal action he&#x2019;d taken had been in his client&#x2019;s best interests. Wattenberg produced a waiver of citation that, if signed by Teddy, would enable probate to go through within three or four days.<br> <br>Anxious about holding up the proceedings, Teddy signed.<br> <br>The state tax man appeared. The safe-deposit box was extracted from the vault and taken to a conference room. The will inside it was compared with the copies read by the Harts, and everyone agreed the copies matched the original document. Wattenberg gave the original to a bank representative, who would forward it to the Surrogate&#x2019;s Court. At this point Richard Rodgers, having no reason to remain, left the bank.<br> <br>Wattenberg led the Harts, both groping for purchase in a fog of legalese, up to the second floor to get Teddy Hart&#x2019;s signature notarized. Wattenberg then handed the notarized waiver and the petition to probate to his associate, who took the documents away to file with the court.<br> <br>The Harts remained in the conference room with Wattenberg, who did his best to placate the befuddled couple, and with Larry Hart&#x2019;s financial manager, William Kron, whose position in the decedent&#x2019;s will was its most perplexing aspect. A full 30 percent of the Lorenz Hart estate was to go to Kron; when he died, that same 30 percent would pass on to his children, and then to his children&#x2019;s children, and so on, presumably until the family stopped reproducing. Although the will bequeathed Teddy Hart 70 percent, with his share going to his wife when she was widowed, no provision was made for their issue; the Harts&#x2019; participation in Lorenz Hart&#x2019;s future royalties, which were sure to be considerable, would end with Dorothy&#x2019;s death. Then the 70 percent share would be payable, in perpetuity, to the Federation of Jewish Philanthropic Societies (later known as the United Jewish Appeal).<br> <br>This was curious, because Larry Hart&#x2014;although he&#x2019;d been bar mitzvahed at Mt. Zion synagogue in Harlem and been generous to several Jewish organizations, notably the Jewish Theatrical Guild&#x2014;was not known to have been devoted to Jewish causes. If the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies maintained a strong link with anyone even remotely involved in the proceedings, it was with Rodgers&#x2019;s wife, Dorothy. Felix Warburg, a close friend of Dorothy Rodgers&#x2019;s family, had been first president of the Federation, and Dorothy Rodgers&#x2019;s mother, May Adelson, was a founder of the Federation&#x2019;s thrift shops. If Dorothy Rodgers had a lifelong cause, it was the battle against anti-Semitism and raising funds to help in that battle. Larry was sympathetic, but the cause wasn&#x2019;t his. William Kron was said to be an ardent supporter of the Federation. It was just as likely, however, that the Federation&#x2019;s inclusion in the will had been engineered by Rodgers to acknowledge his wife&#x2019;s profound interest in the organization.<br> <br>As they left the bank that day, the Harts were drifting into shock. Dorothy knew at least one thing that Wattenberg and the others did not. One week earlier&#x2014;on the day her brother-in-law died, in fact&#x2014;she had gone to her doctor, concerned about abdominal discomfort that she thought was an ulcer, only to learn she was pregnant.<br><br>Larry Hart&#x2019;s will, dated June 17, 1943, was filed in New York City&#x2019;s Surrogate&#x2019;s Court on November 30. The will named Rodgers and Kron as coexecutors and trustees and instructed them to form two trusts out of the residuary estate&#x2014;the Teddy Hart share and the William Kron share. Before there was a residuary estate, however, bequests had to be made. Teddy Hart was bequeathed $5,000 outright, with another $2,500 going to Dorothy. The other legatees were Hart&#x2019;s cousin Sidney Hertz (the family surname before Hart&#x2019;s father changed it); his friend Irving Eisenman; Mary Campbell, known to the Hart family as &#x201c;Big Mary&#x201d; and in their employ as housekeeper for twenty years; and Dr. Milton (&#x201c;Doc&#x201d;) Bender, a dentist turned talent agent who had been as close to Hart as anyone for more than twenty years. These legatees received $2,500 each. Hart&#x2019;s aunts Emma Kahn and Rose Elkan were to receive $2,000 each, as was his uncle William Herman, but Elkan predeceased Hart by six weeks, and the bequest did not pass through to her two children.3 Herman, too, died before probate, his share going back to the residuary estate. Bequests of $2,000 also went to Irene Gallagher, who had spent years with Chappell &amp; Company, one of the more powerful music publishers, and to Rodgers&#x2019;s two daughters, Mary and Linda.<br> <br>As executors, Kron and Rodgers legally seized control of the Rodgers &amp; Hart copyrights and could direct payouts from various income sources, particularly the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, better known as ASCAP. What made Kron&#x2019;s position as a primary beneficiary so baffling, however, was that he had been imposed as accountant on Hart by Rodgers only a few years earlier. Hart was known to be a big spender; so, although he was never poor after 1925, when Rodgers and Hart&#x2019;s Revolutionary War&#x2013;era musical, <i>Dearest Enemy,</i> became a hit, he was frequently broke. In Rodgers&#x2019;s eyes, Kron, who had handled the financial affairs of playwright Edna Ferber and composer Jerome Kern, was the antidote to Larry&#x2019;s devil-may-care attitude about money. The Rodgerses saw Kron as saving not only Larry&#x2019;s money but saving Hart from himself. Dorothy Rodgers said, &#x201c;Willy Kron, Larry&#x2019;s good friend and financial advisor, went away with him for short trips and played endless card games to keep him from drinking.&#x201d;4<br> <br>In 1929, Rodgers and his father, William, a prominent obstetrician known as Will, had opened a savings account for Hart at a bank at Eighty-Sixth and Broadway; Hart&#x2019;s royalty checks, according to Rodgers, went directly into that account. This was something of a hedge against not only Larry&#x2019;s profligate ways but also his generosity&#x2014;supporting his mother and brother for many years, routinely picking up checks for people he barely knew, and being widely known as the softest touch on Broadway. &#x201c;Later on, when there was a great deal more money available,&#x201d; Rodgers remembered, &#x201c;what [Willy Kron] did was virtually the same thing that my father and I did, with one exception. He took Larry&#x2019;s money and distributed it in savings accounts all over the city, in Larry&#x2019;s name. There was no way for Larry to get at it, and no way for anybody else to get at it.&#x201d;5<br> <br>Not everyone saw Kron&#x2019;s caretaking as magnanimous. Kron often appeared in the lobby of the Ardsley, Larry&#x2019;s apartment house on Central Park West, and someone down there&#x2014;a doorman or a friend&#x2014;would phone upstairs to the penthouse to signal that the accountant was on his way up &#x201c;ostensibly to discuss business,&#x201d; as the Hart biographer Frederick Nolan has said, but really to check out the evening&#x2019;s festivities. Everyone tried to scatter before Kron made it up there. &#x201c;It was like dodging the truant officer,&#x201d; Nolan has written. &#x201c;Larry loved it.&#x201d;6<br> <br>&#x201c;The relationship between Kron and Lorenz Hart was, as far as I could see, purely a business relationship,&#x201d; Mary Campbell, the Hart family&#x2019;s devoted cook and housekeeper, testified in New York&#x2019;s Surrogate&#x2019;s Court. &#x201c;Lorenz never expressed any affection for Kron. Kron&#x2019;s children visited very rarely and only when Kron brought them there.&#x201d; If Campbell&#x2019;s testimony suggested that Kron&#x2019;s closeness to Larry had been inflated by the coexecutors, other remarks she made were more troubling.<br> <br>&#x201c;I also heard Kron tell Lorenz Hart that Dorothy Hart, Theodore&#x2019;s wife, was planning to put him in an insane asylum because Dorothy wanted Theodore to inherit Lorenz&#x2019;s money and when he did she would take the money away from Theodore Hart and leave him. On each occasion Kron said he would protect Lorenz against any such acts on the part of Dorothy and that he would see to it that Dorothy would not put him away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lorenz Hart frequently repeated these statements, more particularly when he was under the influence of liquor.&#x201d;<br> <br>Campbell, however, emphasized the Hart brothers&#x2019; mutual fraternal devotion. &#x201c;I have never known two brothers who were more attentive to each other and who loved each other more. When Lorenz spoke of Teddy he frequently cried. Lorenz, during his lifetime, frequently said that whatever he had in life was for his mother and Teddy and when his mother died he said that everything was for Teddy.&#x201d;7<br> <br>If the testimony sounded coached, there was still ample evidence, pictorial as well as written, of how close the brothers were. Larry did not hang photographs of himself, whether pictured alone or with others, in his various residences, but he kept a photograph of Teddy&#x2019;s appearance in the play <i>Three Men on a Horse</i> in his bedroom. Even as adults the two famously undersized men&#x2014;at five feet one or so, Teddy was slightly taller than his older brother&#x2014;had lived and occasionally worked together. Teddy&#x2019;s leading role in <i>The Boys from Syracuse</i> was created for him by Larry. Kron&#x2019;s accusation that Teddy and Dorothy Hart were planning to put Larry away by declaring him insane sounded wild on its face and was almost certainly false.<br> <br>It would be more reasonable to conclude that Larry Hart was being manipulated by Kron, and probably at the direction of Rodgers. Yet Larry drank, according to Doc Bender, &#x201c;morning, noon, and night,&#x201d; and the paranoia that often accompanies such chronic alcoholism had kicked in, exacerbated by the loss of the one person&#x2014;his mother&#x2014;who had given him unconditional love.8<br><br>It was rumored that Larry was bankrupt&#x2014;that those deposits in &#x201c;savings accounts all over the city&#x201d; had vanished. Teddy and Dorothy Hart suspected that all that cash had gone into Willy Kron&#x2019;s pocket. According to an Order to Show Cause for Approval of Compromise Agreement, not counting two insurance policies&#x2014;$100,000 from New York Life, and a separate $10,000 policy that turned up&#x2014;the estate showed a total of $33,462.69&#x2014;more than $29,000 in ASCAP royalties and $4,000 from a checking account.9 But this wasn&#x2019;t enough to pay immediate expenses, including $22,500 in bequests; costs incurred from Larry&#x2019;s last illness and burial, which amounted to $16,500; and Larry&#x2019;s bequest of $1,000 to Mt. Zion Cemetery, in Maspeth, Queens, for the perpetual care of the Hart family plot. (The will makes no mention of cemetery space for Teddy or Dorothy Hart.) It also turned out&#x2014;a shock to the Harts&#x2014;that the New York Life policy erroneously named the estate as beneficiary, not Teddy.<br> <br>This was not even the final insult to the Harts. In the last week of 1943, given the stunning insurance policy mistake and now desperate to slow the probate process, Teddy Hart filed an affidavit in Surrogate&#x2019;s Court stating that his brother had been &#x201c;an alcoholic addict&#x201d; and was subject to undue influence when he had revised his will the previous spring, shortly after the death of his mother. Teddy Hart&#x2019;s affidavit declared: &#x201c;In the last three years of his life he acted like a man mentally unbalanced and one who did not know what he was doing and did not understand the nature of his acts. His friends and business associates recognized this.&#x201d;10 Acknowledging his brother&#x2019;s alcoholism was painful for Teddy, but it was necessary to challenge the will.<br> <br>In a counter-affidavit, Rodgers wrote, &#x201c;If I did not think Lorenz Hart was physically and mentally capable of carrying on with his part in the production of [the revival of <i>A Connecticut Yankee</i>], which required an investment of $100,000, I never would have risked the investment of that large sum nor would I have risked my own professional standing and reputation.&#x201d;11<br> <br>Rodgers was in a tricky position. Through years of Larry&#x2019;s alcoholism, Rodgers had gone to great lengths to get him to work. As early as 1938, during the writing of the stage version of <i>I Married an Angel,</i> Hart&#x2019;s long unexplained absences had greatly truncated the team&#x2019;s writing sessions. Rodgers, if pressed, could write lyrics, sometimes even good lyrics, but they were not Hart lyrics. For two decades Rodgers had hung in, forgiving Hart&#x2019;s tendency to vani...</p><h2>Galapagos</h2><p>Crisp copy with a sturdy binding and light shelf wear.</p><p><b>Henry Nicholls</b> is the author of <i>Lonesome George</i>, which was shortlisted for the 2007 Royal Society Book Prize, and <i>The Way of the Panda</i>.

[F]or a succinct overview of the islands, their history, nature and import, the book is admirable.&#x201d;<br><b> Longitude Books blog</b><br><br> A readable introduction to the natural history of the Galapagos Islands.&#x201d;<br><b> Birdbooker Report</b><br><br> In an enticingly structured, thoroughly enjoyable, rolling narrative, [Nicholls] discusses the islands' volcanic origins, native flora and fauna, and human explorers and residents. He also describes with firsthand excitement and surprising detail what it's like to be in the presence of the islands' remarkably tame wildlife, from the playful red-footed boobies to Pacific green turtles and the enormous tortoises for which the archipelago is named and which were slaughtered to the brink of extinction.... There is no question, as Nicholls eloquently reveals, that we all have a stake in protecting the Gal�pagos.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Booklist</i></b><br><br> With pink iguanas and blue-footed boobies (not to mention red-footed ones that like to hide toy plastic bassoons and other jetsam in their hilltop nests), the islands are a carnival of amazing beings that somehow thrive in a place that has reminded visitors (from a 15th-century Spanish bishop to Herman Melville) of a slag heap or the gates of hell. Henry Nicholls introduces and celebrates these wonders and more in seven short chapters covering the geology, ocean life, seabirds, plants, invertebrates, land birds and reptiles of the archipelago. Three more explore the human impact and the hope that Nicholls and others have for the islands' future.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>The Guardian</i> (UK)</b><br><br> The tale of the Galapagos's solitary giant tortoise and conservation icon was told to great effect by Henry Nicholls in <i>Lonesome George</i>. Sadly, George died in 2012, but happily Nicholls is back with an account that shows why the archipelago that shaped Darwin's ideas still matters to us.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>New Scientist</i>, 2014 books preview</b><br><br> In choosing his topics, Nicholls does what he calls some cherry-picking' and the result is both entertaining and enlightening.... Nicholls navigates [the] complex issues [related to the human population] with care, sensitivity and honesty.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Gal�pagos Digital</i></b><br><br> Tourists should read this book before they visit the Gal�pagos. In a relaxed and conversational style, Henry Nicholls introduces many of the animals and plants that live there, explains why so many are strange and unusual, and shows how natural history has been first shaped by geological history and then influenced by human history. The book is an inspiring call to visit the islands, to experience the animals and plants in the sea and on land, and to join in conserving them.&#x201d;<br><b> Peter Grant, Professor Emeritus, Princeton University, and coauthor of <i>40 Years of Evolution: Darwin's Finches on Daphne Major Island</i></b><br><br> Nicholls's book is filled with fascinating natural history tales, from volcanically-heated seas melting the resin that holds a ship together to encounters with foot-long centipedes, and also includes a sobering, but ultimately hopeful account of the efforts to conserve the archipelago's flora and fauna. It's a book you'd want to read on a plane flight to the Gal�pagos. It's also a book that will make you want to book that flight.&#x201d;<br><b> Alan de Queiroz, author of <i>The Monkey's Voyage</i></b><br><br> This is the perfect book to take with you if you are planning a trip to the Gal�pagos. Even if you are not, this is an enchanting and enlightening account of the most scientifically significant islands in the world.&#x201d;<br><b> Tim Birkhead, author of <i>Bird Sense</i></b><br><br> Henry Nicholls has added an informative, fun, and up-to-date read to the Gal�pagos literature. By sprinkling his discussion of the geology, biology, and history of the islands with quotes from historical figures, including Darwin, the Bishop of Panama, Herman Melville, and many others, he takes the reader on a unique journey of discovery of the wonders of Gal�pagos. He merges historical information with up-to-date science and conservation, then brings the reader back to the sites and species they will see when visiting the islands. Most importantly, he discusses why Gal�pagos matters and the challenge to all of us to ensure its long-term protection.&#x201d;<br><b> Linda J. Cayot, science advisor, Galapagos Conservancy</b><br> <i>The Gal�pagos</i> is an engaging, informative introduction to the natural history of the archipelago. Charles Darwin's observations and insights on the Gal�pagos are effectively used to highlight key aspects of the archipelago's terrestrial and marine environments, the unique plants and animals they support, and how our understanding of them has evolved since his historic visit. The book also gives an accurate account of the current challenges facing Gal�pagos, and how they are being addressed. A surprising amount of information is packed into this concise and entertaining overview. An inspiring pre-travel read for anyone considering a visit to Darwin's Islands'.&#x201d;<br><b> K. Thalia Grant and Gregory B. Estes, authors of <i>Darwin in Galapagos</i></b><br><br> In his new natural history, Henry Nicholls transforms the Gal�pagos archipelago from perennial example to subject. Chapters devoted to geology, plants, animals, and insects finally provide a landscape framework for some of biology's most famous stories from Darwin's finches to the giant tortoises that give the islands their name. Nicholls also includes a welcome and thoughtful discussion of the archipelago's most recent and transformative arrivals, its people.&#x201d;<br><b> Thor Hanson, author of <i>Feathers</i> and <i>The Impenetrable Forest</i></b><br><br> Henry Nicholls has turned his most observant eye on the remarkable, but less often described human history of Gal�pagos. The future of the islands and their distinctive biota will be in the hands of the national lawmakers and growing number of Gal�pagos residents as the isolation enjoyed by Gal�pagos becomes a distant memory. In his lively prose, Henry lauds the unsung scientists and conservation managers who work doggedly and successfully on persistent wildlife management challenges wrought by human accident or design. His persistent focus on stewardship man's absolute responsibility to nature is refreshing and important in the world of natural history literature. A thoughtfully executed and excellent read.&#x201d;<br><b> Johannah Barry, president of the Galapagos Conservancy</b><br><br> If you read one book about the Gal�pagos, make sure it is this. Thoroughly researched, highly informative, lively, and enjoyable, each page is a real pleasure to read. Whether a first time visitor or an old Gal�pagos hand,' Henry Nicholls's <i>The Gal�pagos</i> should accompany you on any physical or virtual trip to these Enchanted Islands&#x201d;.<br><b> Ian Dunn, chief executive officer, Galapagos Conservation Trust</b></p><h2>Quinn's Woman &amp; Home for the Holidays: A 2-in-1 Collection</h2><p><br><br><em>She would not be vulnerable again...</em><br><br>D.

Visit her at SusanMallery.com.<br><br>Sarah Mayberry was born in Melbourne, Australia. Ever since she learned to read and write she has wanted to be an author. She studied professional writing and literature before embarking on various writing-related jobs, working as a magazine editor and in various story-related roles on Australia's longest running serial drama, Neighbours. She inherited a love of romances from both her grandmothers and fulfilled her fondest wish when she was accepted for publication."Try to bring this one back alive," Sheriff Travis Haynes said as he nodded at the slightly built private waiting by the edge of the makeshift podium.<br><br>"Alive I can promise," D. J. Monroe said as she grabbed a rifle from the stack on the table. "In one piece may be more complicated."<br><br>The men standing around chuckled, but the private in question blanched. D.J. tossed him the rifle, grabbed a second one for herself, then started walking. She figured her partner for the next fourteen hours would come trotting along as soon as he figured out she wasn't going to wait for him.<br><br>Sure enough, in about thirty seconds she heard rapid footsteps on the damp ground.<br><br>"What's your name, kid?" she asked when he'd caught up with her.<br><br>"Private Ronnie West, ma'am."<br><br>She gave him a quick once-over. He was tall&#x2014;about six-three to her five-nine&#x2014;skinny and barely shaving. His shock of red hair was bright enough to read by.<br><br>"Are you even eighteen, Ronnie?"<br><br>"Yes, ma'am. Nearly four months ago."<br><br>"You insulted about being paired with a woman?" she asked.<br><br>"No, ma'am." His pale-blue eyes widened as he glanced at her. "I'm honored. My sergeant said you were one of the best and that I was damned lucky to get a chance to watch you work." He ducked his head and blushed. "Excuse me for swearing, ma'am."<br><br>She stopped walking and turned toward him. The annual war games between the emergency services of Glenwood, California&#x2014;sheriff's office, fire department and EMT units&#x2014;and the local Army base were a chance for all concerned to practice, learn and have fun. The morning had been spent on obstacle courses, sharpshooting and tactical planning. D.J. didn't care about any of that. She looked forward to the search and capture phase of the games.<br><br>Between now and 6:00 a.m. tomorrow, she and her partner would be expected to bring in up to five enemy prisoners. For the past two years she'd won that section. It was a point of pride with her. The other players grumbled about her good fortune, not understanding it. Especially when she always took a relatively new recruit as her partner.<br><br>"Ronnie, let's get some ground rules set up," she said. "You can swear all you want. I doubt you can come up with anything I haven't heard. Or said." She smiled at him. "Fair enough?"<br><br>"Yes, ma'am."<br><br>"Good. On this mission, I'm in charge. You're here to listen, learn and follow orders. You get in my way, and I'll cut off your ear. Or something you'll miss even more. Understand?"<br><br>He swallowed hard, then nodded.<br><br>"Last, but most important, you've got a good six inches of height on me and weigh about forty pounds more. Is there any doubt in your mind that I could take you right here, right now?"<br><br>His gaze swept over her body from her Army-issue boots, past her camouflage pants and shirt, to her face.<br><br>He straightened and squared his shoulders. "No, ma'am."<br><br>"As long as we have that straight."<br><br>She ducked into the tent her team used for headquarters and picked up her backpack. Ronnie already had his gear with him. When she stepped back out into the misty afternoon, she pulled a knife from the pack and stuck it into her boot.<br><br>"Check your weapons," she said.<br><br>Ronnie frowned. "They're not loaded."<br><br>"Check them, anyway. You always check."<br><br>"Yes, ma'am."<br><br>He followed her lead and made sure both his side arm and rifle were unloaded. When he'd finished, she pulled her cap lower on her head and wished they could have had sun today. Telling herself the gray skies and low clouds would reduce the risk of shadows didn't make her appreciate the chilly dampness any more. It was nearly July. Shouldn't it be hot?<br><br>Northern California weather was frequently uncooperative, she thought as she set off into the forest. Ronnie trailed after her, making enough noise to pass for a musk ox. At least he wasn't a talker. The one from last year had chatted on and on until she'd been forced to grab him from behind and threaten to slit his throat.<br><br>Two hours later they were deep in "enemy" territory. She slowed their pace in an effort to keep her boy toy from giving away their position. Her oversize shirt was damp and clinging to her skin, which she hated. Water dripped from her hat. It was the kind of day better spent curled up reading, not combing the backwoods for swaggering men who thought they knew it all. Still, the war games helped keep her sharp. For her life was all about maintaining her edge; the book would have to wait.<br><br>Up ahead she sensed more than heard movement. She stopped, as did Ronnie. After silently handing him her backpack and ordering him to wait, she circled around a cluster of trees so that she could come out on the other side.<br><br>A man sat on a log, studying a map. She recognized him as a Fern Hill EMT guy. Midthirties, in decent shape, but not much of a challenge. Oh, well, she had to take what she could get.<br><br>After deliberately stepping on a fallen branch to make it snap, she retreated into the dripping shadow of a thick tree. The man sprang to his feet and turned toward the sound. His backpack lay on the ground, as did his rifle. He wore his sidearm, but she doubted he knew how to use it.<br><br>As the man stepped toward where she'd broken the branch, she circled behind him. When she was less than a foot away, she grabbed his arm, turned him, then swept out her leg to topple him to the ground. He landed hard, with an audible "oof" of air.<br><br>She was already on him. After tossing his sidearm into the brush, she turned him and neatly tied his hands behind his back. She was nearly finished with his feet before he'd even gasped breath back into his body.<br><br>"Okay, kid," she called. "You can come out now."<br><br>Ronnie appeared, carrying her backpack. He stared open-mouthed at the tied man.<br><br>"That was so great," he told her. "Really fast and smooth. He never heard you coming."<br><br>The EMT guy didn't look amused. "Now what?" he asked.<br><br>D.J. smiled. "Now you relax while we search out other prey. I'm not wasting Ronnie's time by having him head back to headquarters with just one guy."<br><br>"No way. You can't leave me. It's raining. The ground is wet."<br><br>D.J. shrugged. "It's war."<br><br>He was still yelling when they were nearly a quarter mile away. She would have liked to tape his mouth, but it violated the rules of the game.<br><br>Pity.<br><br>An hour later they came upon three men standing together, smoking. They were talking and laughing, obviously unconcerned about the potential for being captured.<br><br>D.J. studied the situation, then pulled Ronnie back far enough for them to have a whispered conversation.<br><br>"If you want to win, you have to be willing to do whatever it takes," she said as she slipped off her backpack. "Catch the enemy off guard with the unexpected. I'm going to wait while you get into position. You'll head east and circle around them. When I walk into the clearing, you'll be directly in front of me and behind them. When they're distracted, walk in with your rifle pointed at their backs."<br><br>Ronnie nodded, but she saw the doubt in his eyes. He wanted to know how she was going to manage to distract three men at the same time. She smiled. It was so easy.<br><br>First she shrugged out of her long-sleeved shirt. Underneath she wore an olive green tank and no bra. Ronnie's eyes widened.<br><br>She narrowed her gaze. He blushed, took a step back and stuttered an apology.<br><br>While he was busy wondering if she was going to cut off an ear...or something worse...she pulled the tank up to just below her breasts, twisted the fabric into a knot and tucked it against her skin. The stretchy fabric now pulled tight across her breasts and left her midsection bare. Next she loosened the drawstring waist of her pants and rolled them down to her hipbones. She stuck her sidearm into her pants at the small of her back. Last, she dropped her cap to the ground and unfastened the braid. When her long hair was free, she bent at the waist and finger combed the waves in a sexy disarray. She straightened and tossed her head back. Her brown hair went flying.<br><br>Ronnie's mouth dropped open. "You're gorgeous," he said, then gasped and quickly retreated. "Sorry, ma'am. I didn't mean to&#x2014;"<br><br>She cut him off with a wave of her hands. "It's fine. Go get in position. I'll give you a two-minute head start."<br><br>She waited the promised amount of time, then headed for the group of men. They were still standing around, talking and smoking. She stuck out her chest, then sauntered toward them, trying to look both easy and lost.<br><br>"I am <i>so</i> turned around," she said in a low voice. "Can any of your gentlemen help me?"<br><br>They were all regular Army, officers and seasoned professionals. But they didn't expect to see a half-dressed woman in the woods. It was damp and cold, so she wasn't the least bit surprised when their gazes all locked on her chest.<br><br>The oldest man took a step toward her. "What seems to be the problem, ma'am?"<br><br>They were all such idiots, she thought happily. They'd left their rifles leaning against a tree. Just one more step and the firearms would be out of reach.<br><br>D.J. stuck her hand into her hair and began to twirl a curl around her finger. "This is so not me," she said. "I mean what was I thinking? I don't even remember what team I'm on. I signed up for the games because my boyfriend asked me to, then the jerk dumped me three days ago." She blinked, as if fighting tears. "I'm cold and tired and lonely."<br><br>The men moved in for the kill.<br><br>"Hold it right there! Arms in the air."<br><br>She had to give Ronnie credit. He sounded positively powerful as he gave the order. The men turned toward him. When they looked back, she had her handgun pointed at them.<br><br>Two of the officers swore, one laughed. "Hell of a show," he said.<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>In a matter of minutes, all three of them were tied up. The limit for captures was five. There was a bonus for up to four brought in before midnight. The earlier the "enemies" were brought back to camp, the bigger the bonus. D.J. had figured it would take her and Ronnie until at least nine or ten to get four, but they'd gotten lucky.<br><br>After the men were tied up, she unrolled her pants back to her waist and loosened her tank top. When she'd collected her gear, she shrugged back into her shirt.<br><br>"Don't get dressed on our account," one of the Army officers said with a grin. "Naked suits you."<br><br>"How flattering," she said, and turned her back on him. Why did men always assume women were interested in their attentions?<br><br>"You remember where the EMT guy is?" she asked Ronnie.<br><br>"Yes, ma'am."<br><br>"All right. Take these three with you and collect him. After you escort them back to headquarters, make sure they give us our bonus points, then meet me here. I'll be within a quarter mile of this position." She chuckled as she remembered his lack of stealth. "I'm sure I'll hear you coming."<br><br>"Yes, ma'am."<br><br>D.J. watched as her boy toy led away their prisoners. The officers were only loosely tied together. Rules of engagement required that they cooperate on the trip back in. They were allowed to do whatever it took to get away right up until that first step toward camp. But just in case they decided to give her private the slip, she'd taken down their names.<br><br>When she was alone, D.J. sank onto a log and drew her backpack close. The misting had finally stopped. It was nearing sunset, and the day wasn't going to get any warmer. She thought about starting a fire, but that would mean giving away her position. Something she didn't want to do. If no one got too close, she would stay right where she was until Ronnie returned. If she had to hide, she figured the odds of him finding her were close to zero. She would give him two hours to make his way to camp and come back. The return trip would be faster because he would flag down one of the jeeps circling the forest. If he didn't make it in the time she allowed, she would find one more potential prisoner herself and get back into camp by midnight.<br><br>Forty-five minutes into the first hour, D.J. heard something. It wasn't footsteps or brush moving. She couldn't actually place the sound, but it made the hairs on her arms stand up and her senses go on alert.<br><br>Someone was out there.<br><br>She silently slid off the log and into the shadowy protection of a tree trunk. After concealing her pack under some leaves, she confirmed she had her sidearm in place, then set out to find whoever was approaching.<br><br>She headed east first, then south to end up behind him. She worked on instinct, still not hearing anything specific, but knowing he was there. There were no bent twigs to give her direction, no footsteps, no startled birds or squirrels.<br><br>A couple of times she nearly convinced herself she'd been imagining the almost-noise and she started to return to her backpack. Then she would shiver, as if someone had raked nails on a chalkboard and she would know he was still out there.<br><br>It took her thirty minutes to make the circuit. When she ended up a few yards away from where she'd started, she was disgusted to find the guy pulling her backpack out from its hiding place. He'd gone right to it, as if he'd known it was there from the beginning. How had he done that?<br><br>D.J. dismissed the question. Once she verified the man had a purple arm band instead of an orange one like hers, she knew he was fair game. While he was bent over her supplies, obviously distracted, she moved in to attack.<br><br>She was less than a foot away when she pressed the barrel of the rifle against his back.<br><br>"Bang, you're dead," she said softly. "Now stand up slowly. Ghosts don't move fast."<br><br>The man calmly closed her backpack and put his hands in the air. "I heard you crashing around out there. What were you doing? Playing dodge ball with some rabbits?"<br><br>She didn't appreciate the question or the smirky tone of voice. For one thing, she knew she'd been quiet. For another, <i>she</i> was the one holding the gun.<br><br>"Keep your hands up," she said as she eased back far enough to keep him from grabbing the rifle.<br><br>When he was standing with his back to her, she considered her situation. The man was tall, a couple of inches over six feet, and well muscled. His stealth told her he wasn't an amateur like many of the participants. Nothing about him was familiar, which meant he was probably Army. Special Forces? Had they sent in a ringer?<br><br>She couldn't see his sidearm, which worried her. His rifle was on the ground next to his pack, but where was the handgun?</p><h2>The Secret of Secrets: Your Key to Subconscious Power</h2><p>Your secret self, that sleeping giant within you, can help you do anything and become anything.

In this self-congratulatory tell-all, she also claims that she softened Ronald Reagan's stance toward Gorbachev, paved the way for a friendly Geneva Summit, helped Reagan win two presidental elections and protected him from potential assassins. She takes credit for helping to shape his "visionary" strategy of particle-beam weapons in space (Star Wars), for giving First Lady Nancy an image-overhaul and for defusing the controversy over the president's visit to Bitburg cemetery where Nazis are buried. Separate chapters cover the birth charts of Reagan and Gorbachev and the "breathless possibilities" in the chemistry between them. Although this tiresome memoir would have worked better as a magazine article, it offers an intimate, different, unintentionally devastating slant on the Reagan White House. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>We All Went on Safari (Travel the World)</h2><p>Join Arusha, Mosi, Tumpe and their Maasai friends as they set out on a counting journey through the grasslands of Tanzania.

Laura Silver is a newly hired English teacher at the prestigious Edwards High School in Washington, D.C. On the street one day, she strikes up a conversation with Sam Gordon, fellow instructor of economics at Edwards. Despite Sam's fanatical devotion to free-market capitalism, bleeding-heart liberal Laura finds she enjoys their verbal sparring. Over the course of the school year, Laura and Sam run into one another on campus and around town, each time learning more about the other and delving further into political and economic topics. Meanwhile, an out-of-the-ordinary subplot pits ruthless Charles Krauss, CEO of mega-corporation HeathNet, against smart and savvy Erica Baldwin, director of the consumer watchdog agency, the Office of Corporate Responsibility, with their vicious sparring illustrating Sam and Laura's abstract arguments. It's an understatement to say that this is a novel with an agenda the agenda is the story here. Readers with a basic sympathy for deregulation and capitalist hegemony will enjoy Sam and Laura's intellectual adventures best, but students of economics across the board may find this fictionalized debate engaging and informative.

This firsthand account, based on Enright's recollections and statements by American and Japanese veterans of the action, can be recommended without hesitation as a WW II naval classic. While the basic story is simple, its unfolding is as complexly gripping as a chess match between grandmasters. The opponents: Commander Enright and his counterpart, Capt. Toshio Abe, commander of Shinano. On November 29, 1944, the aircraft carrier, escorted by three destroyers, was only 17 hours into its maiden voyage when four perfectly placed torpedoes, launched by Enright's Archer-Fish, sent it to the bottom near the entrance to Tokyo Bay. The meticulously unfolding narrative, told alternately from the points of view of the plotting-room and periscope of Archer-Fish and the captain's bridge aboard Shinano, is mainly concerned with Enright's struggle to gain position ahead of the zigzagging carrier and maneuver into an elusive firing-window that would be open only for a few seconds. Coauthor Ryan's previous books include Who Killed the Red Baron? Photos. Military Book Club main selection. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Enright was captain of USS Archer-Fish when it torpedoed Shinano in November 1944. Both his first-person account of the operation and his candid analysis of his development as a submarine commander will be particularly interesting to naval buffs. The U.S. perspective is balanced by a reconstruction of Shinano 's first and last vogage from accounts by Japanese survivors. The work would have benefited from an opening chapter placing the operation in the context of the Pacific War. It also tarnishes Enright's achievement by exaggeration. Shinano may have been the largest aircraft carrier of World War II; it was not a "supership," or even an attack carrier. It was intended to operate as a support ship for fleet operations. This does not diminish the U.S. triumph. Military Book Club main selection.Dennis E.

White House Red Carpet<br><br>The sun shone brightly as three flags&#x2014;�the American, Japanese, and District of Columbian&#x2014;�riffled in a breeze. As the camera panned across the Washington, D.C., cityscape, four howitzers boomed a nineteen-�gun salute on the South Lawn. It was Tuesday, November 14, 1967, and Julia Child was taking her audience somewhere they had never been before.<br><br>&#x201c;Welcome to Washington. I&#x2019;m Julia Child, out here in front of the East Gate of the White House, where every day thousands of visitors go through this historic mansion. And today, something very special is going on,&#x201d; she said in her distinctly breathy, high-�low warble. Hundreds of tourists streamed through the White House, also known as the People&#x2019;s House, clogging the halls and gawking at the formal dining rooms just hours before an important state dinner.<br><br>&#x201c;These visits are terribly important. And also terribly complicated to handle. It&#x2019;s really fascinating to see how the White House manages one of them,&#x201d; Julia narrated. &#x201c;And that&#x2019;s exactly what we&#x2019;re going to see. Not only what goes on in front, but what goes on backstage, and backstairs. We&#x2019;re going to see everything, inside and out, from the start&#x2014;�the official greeting right on through to the White House dinner.&#x201d;<br><br>Thus began a public television special called White House Red Carpet. Produced by WGBH, Julia&#x2019;s home public television station in Boston, it was the first time that a TV crew had been allowed to document a state dinner. It also marked the first time in more than two years that Julia had appeared on the tube with fresh material. Season One of her cooking show, The French Chef, aired from February 1963 through July 1966, when Julia took a break and the show went into reruns. By then she had firmly established herself as &#x201c;the kitchen magician,&#x201d; as The Boston Globe called her. With more than a million viewers a week, Julia encouraged her audience to cook boldly and take risks without fear of failure. &#x201c;Eat heartily!&#x201d; she declared, and, &#x201c;Never apologize!&#x201d; Her fans referred to her simply as &#x201c;Julia,&#x201d; as if they knew her personally.<br><br>Julia had taken a sabbatical for two reasons: she had been hard at work with her French colleague Simone &#x201c;Simca&#x201d; Beck, on a follow-�up to their cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking; and she was waiting for color television to become a reality. By November 1967, the book was coming together and WGBH had received its first color cameras. With White House Red Carpet, Julia was making a dramatic return to the national spotlight.<br><br>A robust fifty-�five years old, Julia stood more than six feet two inches tall, had a long face with a rounded jaw, frizzy brown hair, lively blue eyes, strong hands, and usually dressed in pearls, a blue apron, and size-�twelve sneakers. At the White House she wore a stylish black-�and-�white checked coat, a shoulder-�length brown wig with a flip curl (for convenience: constant hairdos during a multiday TV shoot were a burden), and an impish grin.<br><br>The idea for a White House TV special was sparked in 1966&#x2014;�&#x201c;the year that everyone seems to be cooking in the kitchen with Julia,&#x201d; noted Time magazine&#x2014;�when the Public Broadcasting Laboratory (PBL) asked if she would like to do a thirty-�minute special about &#x201c;What&#x2019;s Happening Now.&#x201d; Avid news watchers, Julia and Paul drew up a list of potential ideas.<br><br>Paul&#x2019;s voice was important. He was an equal partner in their joint venture: Julia&#x2019;s mentor, editor, manager, confidant, bodyguard, staff photographer, sommelier, and culinary &#x201c;guinea pig.&#x201d; He avoided the limelight and described himself as &#x201c;a part of the iceberg that doesn&#x2019;t show.&#x201d; While she was a blast of sound and a ray of sunlight, he was more internalized, with a quieter, moodier demeanor and a sometimes prickly intellect. Julia and Paul were &#x201c;a team,&#x201d; they said, &#x201c;two sides of a coin,&#x201d; and they often signed their joint letters &#x201c;JP&#x201d; or &#x201c;Pulia.&#x201d;<br><br>In answering PBL&#x2019;s request, the Childs proposed a documentary film about President Charles de Gaulle&#x2019;s decision to relocate the Les Halles food market&#x2014;�dubbed &#x201c;the belly of Paris&#x201d; by �mile Zola&#x2014;�from the city center to a suburb near Orly airport to make room for a modern, American-�style shopping complex. The move was controversial, and loaded with the symbolism of France leaving behind the darkness of two World Wars, the Suez Crisis, and Vietnam in favor of a shiny, bright, space-�age future. The Childs were horrified by the decision. While living in Paris, they had spent countless hours shopping at Les Halles, and loved its teeming Old World alleys, wrought-�iron arcades, hollering shopkeeps, bins of varicolored flowers, stacks of raw vegetables, piles of copper pots, racks of knives, bottles of olive oil, barrels of wine, and the like. They wanted to document the lively, odiferous, chaotic marketplace before it was replaced by a smooth concrete, smoked glass, and blandly efficient shopping mall.<br><br>PBL accepted their plan to document Les Halles, then rejected it as too expensive. The Childs were disappointed, if not entirely surprised: the lack of funding and clear editorial vision were familiar hurdles in �public television. They cast about for a new subject, a food story with &#x201c;visual drama&#x201d; located closer to their home in Cambridge, �Massachusetts.<br><br>It is likely that Paul&#x2014;�a former diplomat, who understood the symbolic and practical aspects of state dinners&#x2014;�suggested a documentary about the White House. And Julia knew that President Johnson employed Henry Haller, a highly regarded Swiss-�born, French-�trained chef. They both understood that the president could use a positive boost in the media. The year 1967 had been tumultuous: the Vietnam War was grinding painfully on, and race relations were tense at home; Johnson was under attack from both the left and right and had shrunk from public appearances. This dark state of affairs presented public television with an opportunity, Paul thought: &#x201c;Why not show a side of the People&#x2019;s House that most of the People have never seen?&#x201d;<br><br>The Childs pitched PBL a documentary about what happens behind the scenes at a state dinner. It was a long shot, they knew. But under the circumstances, Julia Child was one of the few people who could have convinced the presidential staff to allow television cameras to poke around 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue&#x2014;�from its elegant public hallways to the first family&#x2019;s private quarters and down into the cramped, quirky kitchen in the basement&#x2014;�during a high-�profile event. As Paul explained in a letter to the columnist Herb Caen, a state dinner &#x201c;isn&#x2019;t about spending the tax payers&#x2019; money on striped pants and pink champagne. It&#x2019;s a function of diplomacy, and only the culminating, externally visible part of a complex series of discussions, decisions, studies, meetings and agreements involving many parts of government.&#x201d;<br><br>PBL withdrew from the Childs&#x2019; project in order to pursue a civil rights program. But National Educational Television (NET)&#x2014;�the main broadcaster of educational TV at the time&#x2014;�picked up the White House special. It took four months of intensive work behind the scenes to turn the seemingly straightforward idea into an actual telecast.<br><br>Julia and her staff at WGBH issued reams of letters, telegrams, and phone messages to convince the White House of the value of such a show (an outspoken Democrat, Julia promised to remain strictly apolitical); stacks of memos to public television brass explaining exactly what they would be getting, and at what cost; and binders of research about the historical, diplomatic, and culinary significance of a state dinner. In a letter to Lady Bird Johnson, the producer Ruth Lockwood explained:<br><br>Everyone is fascinated by the White House and our first family. Millions of us have visited the public rooms, and more millions have toured parts of The White House on television. So far we have seen it only as a shrine with empty rooms. Now we would like to go behind the splendid fa�ade and show how you and your staff make it run so well as an official residence with a home-�like atmosphere . . . The American public-�at-�large has little conception of diplomatic life . . . [and] the tremendous importance that the reception plays in our international affairs.<br><br>The Johnsons hesitated. Rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll, feminism, environmentalism, racial conflicts, and antiwar protests were roiling America. Moreover, the guest of honor at the diplomatic dinner that November was to be Japanese prime minister Eisaku Sato. Japan was an especially important and sensitive ally: despite lingering resentments from the Second World War, Japan was America&#x2019;s leading partner in Asia, and the United States was Japan&#x2019;s biggest customer. Johnson was attempting to manage the optics of his presidency carefully, if not particularly successfully, and was doubtless concerned that Julia and her cameras would get in the way of important negotiations. Yet the first family eventually agreed to invite the Childs and a small TV crew to observe the diplomatic dinner.<br><br>Over four days WGBH filmed scenic shots of Julia in Washington, interviewing key presidential staff members (though not the first couple, per White House etiquette), and exploring the grand dining rooms and narrow stairwells of the People&#x2019;s House. Then it was time for the main event.<br><br>it had been 167 years since John Adams hosted the first diplomatic party at the White House. After exploring the building, which was built in the 1790s by George Washington, Paul wrote that it remained &#x201c;essentially an 18th-�century gentleman&#x2019;s mansion in its original conception.&#x201d; In fact, President Harry S. Truman had completely renovated the rickety building in 1952, after he took a bath, felt the floor tremble, and nearly crashed through it onto his wife, Bess, and a group from the Daughters of the American Revolution. Truman insisted on a nearly exact replica of the old rooms, including what seemed to be miles of winding passageways, creaky stairs, and mysterious nooks and crannies.<br><br>The state dinner would fill two dining rooms, which were decorated with great crystal chandeliers, tall and heavily draped windows, and round tables graced by flowers, crystal goblets, candles, and gold-�and-�white plates ornamented with the presidential seal. A floor below, in the basement, the kitchen was tiny, about eighteen feet square, with shiny white walls, gray linoleum floors, roaring ventilation fans, stainless-�steel counters, and hanging pots and spoons, all lit by fluorescent lights.<br><br>The cramped space, Paul noted, made &#x201c;the back-�of-�the-�stage operations humanly difficult, so potentially interesting to the American public if the PR people don&#x2019;t insist on a shiny, no-�trouble image.&#x201d;<br><br>As WGBH&#x2019;s cameras panned down bustling hallways on the afternoon of November 14, the last tourists were being ushered out and the chief housekeper, Mrs. Mary Kaltman, who oversaw &#x201c;everything from lightbulbs to lobsters,&#x201d; checked that each of the nineteen tables had a flower bouquet and place cards. Mrs. Carpenter, Lady Bird&#x2019;s press secretary, said of the library: &#x201c;I love this room, but in the days of Abigail Adams, it&#x2019;s where she kept her milk cows, and so we laughingly say, &#x2018;We&#x2019;ve moved from moos to news.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Until the Eisenhowers hired the first White House chef, food at the People&#x2019;s House was prepared by navy stewards. In 1961, the Kennedys hired Ren� Verdon, a highly regarded French chef from the Carlyle Hotel in New York. Verdon prepared a lamb luncheon for Princess Grace of Monaco, and trout Chablis for the British prime minister Harold Macmillan. After President Kennedy&#x2019;s assassination, Verdon stayed on with the Johnsons. But he resigned in 1965, protesting LBJ&#x2019;s insistence on serving garbanzo bean pur�e, the use of canned and frozen vegetables (to keep costs down), and other creative differences. &#x201c;You do not serve barbecued spareribs at a banquet with ladies in white gloves!&#x201d; huffed Verdon.<br><br>The new executive chef, Henry Haller, led a team of four sous-�chefs and a staff of many other, mostly African American, assistants. Haller&#x2014;�a confident, robust, hawk-�faced man trained in classical French cuisine&#x2014;�had apprenticed in Davos, then immigrated to the United States after the Second Word War. He met his Brooklyn-�born wife, Carol, on Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard. When the job offer came from the White House, Haller was executive chef at the Hampshire House hotel in Manhattan, where then Vice President Johnson had enjoyed his cooking.<br><br>Haller&#x2019;s workday began at 6:00 a.m. and ended after midnight, but he was paid far less than chefs of his caliber earned in top restaurants. Nevertheless, he declared, &#x201c;there is no better job&#x201d; than running the president&#x2019;s kitchen. He was a phlegmatic sort who didn&#x2019;t mind the pressure of the job. When the king of Saudi Arabia arrived with his own food stuffed into five briefcases and with a royal food taster as well, Haller smiled. Though the Johnsons employed Zephyr Wright, an African American woman, to cook Southern-�style family meals, there were times when Haller was required to whip up lunch for foreign dignitaries from whatever he could find in the pantry&#x2014;�for which the president was eternally grateful.<br><br>&#x201c;Many Americans who dislike President Johnson half-�believe that dinner at the White House is limited to such gustatory curiosities as Pedernales Chili and enchiladas,&#x201d; Paul wrote in The Economist. &#x201c;Alas for prejudice! The truth is that official food at the White House is �delectable.&#x201d;<br><br>To prepare for 190 guests, Haller had been cooking for three days by the time that Julia and her camera crew arrived. Dressed in chef&#x2019;s whites and a toque, he barked orders, cracked jokes, and prepared a sumptuous seafood vol-�au-�vent&#x2014;�lobster, bay scallops, tiny shrimp, and quenelles (fish dumplings) in a pastry crust, topped with a sauce am�ricaine.<br><br>&#x201c;Hmmmm,&#x201d; Julia murmured, as she craned her tall body over a steaming pot, closed her eyes, and inhaled the seafood aroma. &#x201c;Can I have a little taste?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Czertainly!&#x201d; Haller replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s awfully good,&#x201d; she cooed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s lovely.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ze taste hasz to go wis ze prezentation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Everything in the kitchen is timed to the minute from now on,&#x201d; Julia narrated, like a play-�by-�play announcer. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all keyed to what&#x2019;s going on upstairs.&#x201d;<br><br>By the front door under the North Portico, string instruments serenaded the guests, who wore black tie and exited limousines to a barrage of flashing bulbs. Vice President and Mrs. Hubert Humphrey made their way through the mob of reporters. Foreign ambassadors and deputy ministers led American governors and local pols, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, the chairman of U.S. Steel, Johnson backers from Waco and Cleveland and Alabama, a poet, a Rockefeller, the president of CBS, and the president of the International Union of Operating Engineers.<br><br>Japanese prime minister Sato, a short man dressed in an impeccably tailored suit, and his diminutive wife, wearing glasses and a white kimono, bowed and smiled. Sato was known to be &#x201c;intensely interested in baseball,&#x201d; and so the commissioner of baseball, General William D. Eckert, and the St. Louis Cardinals&#x2019;s pitcher Bob Gibson had been invited. Sato was also a jazz lover, and the White House had arranged for a special musical guest to entertain at the end of the evening.</p><h2>The Amazing Book Is Not on Fire: The World of Dan and Phil</h2><p><b>THE INSTANT #1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER</b><br><br>From YouTube sensations Dan Howell (danisnotonfire) and Phil Lester (AmazingPhil) comes a laugh-out-loud look into the world created by two awkward guys who share their lives on the Internet.

Replete with rich religious imagery, <i>Many Dimensions</i> explores the relation between predestination and free will as it depicts different human responses to redemptive transcendence.</p><p>Imagine <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> set in 20th-century London, and then imagine it written by a man steeped not in Hollywood movies but in Dante and the things of the spirit, and you might begin to get a picture of Charles Williams's novel <i>Many Dimensions</i>. The plot turns on the discovery of the magical Stone of Solomon, through which one can move at will through space, time, and thought. Those who think they can manipulate the stone to serve their own ends, however, find to their horror that, as Jesus once ironically said, "they have their reward." While the story clearly deals with the extraordinary, through his humorous and loving depiction of his British characters Williams more deeply shows us the spiritual reality that lies inside the ordinary. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i>(1886-1945) An intense, imaginative, magnetic person,Charles Williams was a member of the Inklings, the group ofcreative Oxford Christians of the 1930s and 1940s thatincluded C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. Though heexcelled in many literary genres, Williams is bestremembered for his poetry and his originalfiction&#x2015;contemporary religious novels filled withsuspense, mystery, and supernatural conflict.</p><h2>Ancient Light</h2><p>Is there a difference between memory and invention? That is the question that haunts Alexander Cleave as he reflects on his first, and perhaps only, love&#x2014;an underage affair with his best friend&#x2019;s mother. When his stunted acting career is suddenly, inexplicably revived with a movie role playing a man who may not be who he claims, his young leading lady&#x2014;famous and fragile&#x2014;unwittingly gives him the opportunity to see, with startling clarity, the gap between the things he has done and the way he recalls them. Profoundly moving, Ancient Light is written with the depth of character, clarifying lyricism, and heart-wrenching humor that mark all of Man Booker Prize-winning author John Banville&#x2019;s extraordinary works.</p><p>John Banville, the author of fifteen previous novels, has been the recipient of the Man Booker Prize, the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, the Guardian<i> </i>Fiction Award, the Franz Kafka Prize and a Lannan Literary Award for Fiction. He lives in Dublin.I<br><br>Billy Gray was my best friend and I fell in love with his mother. Love may be too strong a word but I do not know a weaker one that will apply. All this happened half a century ago. I was fifteen and Mrs. Gray was thirty-five. Such things are easily said, since words themselves have no shame and are never surprised. She might be living still. She would be, what, eighty-three, eighty-four? That is not a great age, these days. What if I were to set off in search of her? That would be a quest. I should like to be in love again, I should like to fall in love again, just once more. We could take a course of monkey-gland injections, she and I, and be as we were fifty years ago, helpless in raptures. I wonder how things are with her, assuming she is still of this earth. She was so unhappy then, so unhappy, she must have been, despite her valiant and unfailing cheeriness, and I dearly hope she did not continue so.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I recall of her, here in these soft pale days at the lapsing of the year? Images from the far past crowd in my head and half the time I cannot tell whether they are memories or inventions. Not that there is much difference between the two, if indeed there is any difference at all. Some say that without realising it we make it all up as we go along, embroidering and embellishing, and I am inclined to credit it, for Madam Memory is a great and subtle dissembler. When I look back all is flux, without beginning and flowing towards no end, or none that I shall experience, except as a final full stop. The items of flotsam that I choose to salvage from the general wreckage&#x2014;and what is a life but a gradual shipwreck?&#x2014;may take on an aspect of inevitability when I put them on display in their glass showcases, but they are random; representative, perhaps, perhaps compellingly so, but random nonetheless.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were for me two distinct initial manifestations of Mrs. Gray, years apart. The first woman may not have been she at all, may have been only an annunciation of her, so to speak, but it pleases me to think the two were one. April, of course. Remember what April was like when we were young, that sense of liquid rushing and the wind taking blue scoops out of the air and the birds beside themselves in the budding trees? I was ten or eleven. I had turned in at the gates of the Church of Mary Our Mother Immaculate, head down as usual&#x2014;Lydia says I walk like a permanent penitent&#x2014;and the first presage I had of the woman on the bicycle was the fizzing of tyres, a sound that seemed to me excitingly erotic when I was a boy, and does so even yet, I do not know why. The church stood on a rise, and when I looked up and saw her approaching with the steeple beetling at her back it seemed thrillingly that she had come swooping down out of the sky at just that moment, and that what I had heard was not the sound of tyres on the tarmac but of rapid wings beating the air. She was almost upon me, freewheeling, leaning back relaxedly and steering with one hand. She wore a gaberdine raincoat, the tails of it flapping behind to right and left of her like, yes, like wings, and a blue jumper over a blouse with a white collar. How clearly I see her! I must be making her up, I mean I must be making up these details. Her skirt was wide and loose, and now all at once the spring wind caught it and lifted it, laying her bare all the way up to her waist. Ah, yes.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays we are assured that there is hardly a jot of difference between the ways in which the sexes experience the world, but no woman, I am prepared to wager, has ever known the suffusion of dark delight that floods the veins of a male of any age, from toddler to nonagenarian, at the spectacle of the female privy parts, as they used quaintly to be called, exposed accidentally, which is to say fortuitously, to sudden public view. Contrary, and disappointingly I imagine, to female assumptions, it is not the glimpsing of the flesh itself that roots us men to the spot, our mouths gone dry and our eyes out on stalks, but of precisely those silken scantlings that are the last barriers between a woman&#x2019;s nakedness and our goggling fixity. It makes no sense, I know, but if on a crowded beach on a summer day the swimsuits of the female bathers were to be by some dark sorcery transformed into underwear, all of the males present, the naked little boys with their pot bellies and pizzles on show, the lolling, muscle-bound lifeguards, even the hen-pecked husbands with trouser-cuffs rolled and knotted hankies on their heads, all, I say, would be on the instant transformed and joined into a herd of bloodshot, baying satyrs bent on rapine.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thinking particularly of those olden days when I was young and women under their dresses&#x2014;and which of them then did not wear a dress, save the odd golfing girl or spoilsport film star in her pleated slacks?&#x2014;might have been fitted out by a ship&#x2019;s chandler, with all sorts and shapes of rigging and sheeting, jibs and spankers, sheers and stays. My Lady of the Bicycle, now, with her taut suspenders and pearly-white satin knickers, had all the dash and grace of a trim schooner plying fearlessly into a stiff nor&#x2019;wester. She seemed as startled as I by what the breeze was doing to her modesty. She looked down at herself and then at me and raised her eyebrows and made an O of her mouth, and gave a gurgling laugh and smoothed the skirt over her knees with a careless sweep of the back of her free hand and sailed blithely past. I thought her a vision of the goddess herself, but when I turned to look after her she was just a woman rattling along on a big black bike, a woman with those flaps or epaulettes on the shoulders of her coat that were fashionable then, and crooked seams in her nylons, and boxy hair just like my mother&#x2019;s. She slowed prudently in the gateway, her front wheel wobbling, and gave a chirrup on her bell before proceeding out into the street and turning left down Church Road.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not know her, had never seen her before, so far as I knew, though I would have thought that by then I had seen everyone in our tight little town at least once. And did I in fact see her again? Is it possible that she was indeed Mrs. Gray, the same one who four or five years later would irrupt so momentously into my life? I cannot summon up the features of the woman on the bike clearly enough to say for sure if she truly was or was not an early sighting of my Venus Domestica, though I cling to the possibility with wistful insistence.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What affected me so in that encounter in the churchyard, besides the raw excitement of it, was the sense I had of having been granted a glimpse into the world of womanhood itself, of having been let in, if only for a second or two, on the great secret. What thrilled and charmed me was not just the sight I got of the woman&#x2019;s shapely legs and fascinatingly complicated underthings, but the simple, amused and generous way that she looked down at me, doing that throaty laugh, and the negligent, backhanded grace with which she subdued her ballooning skirt. This must be another reason why she has become merged in my mind with Mrs. Gray, why she and Mrs. Gray are for me the two faces of the one precious coin, for grace and generosity were the things I treasured, or should have treasured, in the first and, I sometimes disloyally think&#x2014;sorry, Lydia&#x2014;only real passion of my life. Kindness, or what they used to call loving-kindness, was the watermark discernible in Mrs. Gray&#x2019;s every gesture towards me. I think I am not being overly fond. I did not deserve her, I know that now, but how could I have known it then, being a mere boy, callow and untried? No sooner have I written down those words than I hear the weaselly whine in them, the puling attempt at self-�exculpation. The truth is I did not love her enough, I mean I did not love her as I had it in me to do, young as I was, and I think she suffered for it, and that is all there is to say on the subject, though I am sure that will not stop me from saying a great deal more.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her name was Celia. Celia Gray. It does not sound quite right, does it, that combination? Women&#x2019;s married names never sound right, in my opinion. Is it that they all marry the wrong men, or at any rate men with the wrong surnames? Celia and Gray make altogether too languid a coupling, a slow hiss followed by a soft thud, the hard g in Gray not half hard enough. She was not languid, anything but. If I say she was buxom that fine old word will be misunderstood, will be given too much weight, literally and figuratively. I do not think she was beautiful, at least not conventionally so, although I suppose a boy of fifteen could hardly have been called on to award the golden apple; I did not think of her as beautiful or otherwise; I fear that, after the initial gloss had gone dull, I did not think of her at all, but took her, however gratefully, for granted.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A memory of her, a sudden image coming back unbidden, was what set me stumbling off down Memory Lane in the first place. A thing she used to wear, called a half-slip, I believe&#x2014;yes, undergarments again&#x2014;a slithery, skirt-length affair in salmon-coloured silk or nylon, would leave, when she had taken it off, a pink weal where the elastic waistband had pressed into the pliant, silvery flesh of her belly and flanks, and, though less discernibly, at the back, too, above her wonderfully prominent bum, with its two deep dimples and the knubbled, slightly sandpapery twin patches underneath, where she sat down. This rosy cincture encircling her middle stirred me deeply, suggestive as it was of tender punishment, exquisite suffering&#x2014;I was thinking of the harem, no doubt, of branded houris and the like&#x2014;and I would lie with my cheek resting on her midriff and trace the crimpled line of it with a slow fingertip, my breath stirring the shiny dark hairs at the base of her belly and in my ear the pings and plonks of her innards at their ceaseless work of transubstantiation. The skin was always hotter along that uneven, narrow track left by the elastic, where the blood crowded protectively to the surface. I suspect, too, I was savouring the blasphemous hint that it gave of the crown of thorns. For our doings together were pervaded throughout by a faint, a very faint, sickly religiosity.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>I pause to record or at least to mention a dream I had last night in which my wife had left me for another woman. I do not know what this might signify, or if it signifies anything, but certainly it has left an impression. As in all dreams the people in this one were plainly themselves and at the same time not, my wife, to take the principal player, appearing as short, blonde and bossy. How did I know it was she, looking so unlike herself as she did? I, too, was not as I am, but corpulent and ponderous, sag-eyed, slow-moving, a kind of an old walrus, say, or some other soft, lumbering water-going mammal; there was the sense of a sloped back, leathery and grey, disappearing slidingly around a rock. So there we were, lost to each other, she not she and I not I.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife harbours no sapphic inclinations, so far as I know&#x2014;though how far is that?&#x2014;but in the dream she was cheerfully, briskly, butch. The object of her transferred affections was a strange little man-like creature with wispy sideburns and a faint moustache and no hips, a dead ringer, now that I think of it, for Edgar Allan Poe. As to the dream proper I shall not bore you, or myself, with the details. Anyway, as I think I have already said, I do not believe we retain details, or if we do they are so heavily edited and censored and generally fancified as to constitute a new thing altogether, a dream of a dream, in which the original is transfigured, as the dream itself transfigures waking experience. This does not prevent me from crediting dreams with all sorts of numinous and prophetic implications. But surely it is too late in the day for Lydia to leave me. All I know is that this morning I woke in the pre-dawn hour with an oppressive sense of loss and deprivation and all-pervading sadness. Something seems set to happen.<br>I think I was a little in love with Billy Gray before I was a lot in love with his mother. There is that word again, love; how easily it trips off the pen. Strange, thinking of Billy like this. He would be my age now. That is hardly remarkable&#x2014;he was my age then&#x2014;yet it gives me a shock. I feel as if I have suddenly taken a step up&#x2014;or is it a step down?&#x2014;into another phase of ageing. Would I know him if I met him? Would he know me? He was so upset when the scandal broke. I am sure I felt the shock of public disgrace as much as he did, or more so, I should think, but all the same I was taken aback by the passion with which he repudiated me. After all, I would not have minded if he had been sleeping with my mother, difficult though that would have been to imagine&#x2014;I found it difficult to imagine anyone sleeping with Ma, the poor old thing, which was how I thought of her, as poor, and old, and a thing. That surely was what so troubled Billy, having to contemplate the fact that his mother was a woman whom someone desired, and furthermore that the someone was me. Yes, it must have been all kinds of agony for him to picture the two of us rolling naked in each other&#x2019;s arms on that filthy mattress on the floor in Cotter&#x2019;s place. He had probably never seen his mother without her clothes on, or not that he could remember, anyhow.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was he who first stumbled on the Cotter house, and I used to worry that one day he would stumble on his mother and me at our love-play there. Was she aware that Billy knew the place? I cannot remember. If she was, my worry would have been as nothing compared to her terror at the thought of discovery by her only son as she was being made love to by his best friend in the midst of ancient squalor on a dirty, leaf-littered floor.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall the day I first saw the house. We had been in the little hazel wood along by the river, Billy and I, and he had brought me up to a ridge and pointed out the roof among the treetops. From the height on which we stood only the roof was visible, and at first I could not make it out, for the slates were covered with moss as green as the surrounding foliage. That must have been why it remained hidden for so long, and why presently it would make such a secure trysting-place for Mrs. Gray and me. I wanted to go down and break in straight away&#x2014;for we were boys, after all, and still young enough to be on the look-out for what we would have called a club-house&#x2014;but Billy was reluctant, strangely, as it seemed to me, since he had discovered the place and had even been inside it, or so he said. I believe he was a little afraid of that house; perhaps he had a premonition, or thought it haunted, as indeed it soon would be, not by ghosts but by the Lady Venus and her sportive boy.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is odd, but I see our pockets that day filled with hazel nuts we had collected down in the wood and the ground around us plated with the hammered gold of fallen leaves, yet it was April, it had to have been April, the leaves green and still on the trees and the hazel nuts not even formed yet.

With coauthor Gilbert, a former Washington Post sportswriter, "The Dook," as he was dubbed in Flatbush, tells the story of those years excitingly and movingly. We read of Robinson's racial troubles, the inspiration that Dodgers' captain Pee Wee Reese provided for his colleagues and the camaraderie that characterized the team. But the memoir concentrates on the rivalry with the Yankees, whom the Dodgers met often through the 1950s in the World Series and whom they seldom defeated. The book also touches on Snider's post-playing period as a manager and later as a broadcaster in Montreal.

His books often explore America&#x2019;s past, bringing to life its history and traditions. He lives with his wife, Deborah, on a farm in western Massachusetts.Gr. 2-4. Much more than a simple ecology lesson, this picture book dramatizes both the power of nature and the drive of human technology. Giant white pine trees once grew in the New England woods for thousands of years; today there are none. In the eighteenth century, the British needed the trees for their great warships, ships that required masts 40 inches wide at the base, 120 feet tall, and absolutely straight. The facts are astonishing: Forests had to be cleared; roads had to be cut straight because a mast tree couldn't bend around a corner; special mast ships carried the great logs to England. The prose is restrained and lyrical, precise about the mechanism by which the trees were marked, cut down, and hauled to the sea, and romantic about the giants that lived on this land. McCurdy's dramatic black-and-white scratchboard drawings, many spread across two pages, capture the sweep and detail of the landscape, the anguish of the tree felling, and the huge, lumbering procession of the oxen straining at their chains to drag each heavy trunk to the sea. There's no hectoring about the environment, but the sense of grief is manifest; the trees are gone. And then the quiet surprise of the ending: "Step into the woods. . . . Giants are growing." <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>How to Act Right When Your Spouse Acts Wrong</h2><p>Experience the Blessings of an Imperfect Marriage. We all&#x2013;at one time or another&#x2013;have the opportunity to act right when our spouse acts wrong. There are no perfect marriages or perfect spouses. We know that having a good marriage requires effort and hard work. Yet we often don&#x2019;t know how to continue to love when we are angry, hurt, scared, or just plain irritated. Nor are we sure what that kind of love is supposed to look like. Should we be patient? Forgive and forget? Do something else entirely? <br><br>Acting right when your spouse acts wrong will not necessarily guarantee a more satisfying marital relationship, nor will it automatically make your spouse change his or her ways&#x2013;although both could occur. It will, however, help you see how God is stretching you in the midst of your marital difficulties, teach you to respond wisely when wronged, and lead you into a deeper relationship with Christ as you yield your will to his plan for your life and learn to be more like him.</p><p><b>Leslie Vernick</b>, ACSW, LCSW, is a licensed clinical social worker who has her own private counseling practice and more that twenty years of experience counseling Christians from a biblical worldview.

All of us at one time or another face the dilemma of choosing to act right when our spouse acts wrong.<br><br>Whenever our spouse disappoints us, fails us, hurts us, or just plain irritates us, whether in big ways or little ways, <i>from our perspective</i> he or she is wrong.<br><br>Sin is in all of us (Romans 3:23). Attitudes and behaviors that come out of a self-centered, selfish, prideful, deceived, and/or rebellious heart often express themselves in big, bad ways such as infidelity, lying, addictions, or abuse. The same sinful heart can also produce more benign but chronically irritating behaviors such as nagging and criticism, forgetting important occasions, failing to put dirty laundry in the hamper, not listening well, or staying glued to the television when our spouse is attempting to have a conversation with us. It can be just as difficult and discouraging to believe God and live by faith with a spouse who sins in subtle, less blatant ways as it can when a spouse commits the more grievous wrongs.<br><br>Most of us acknowledge that there are no perfect marriages or perfect spouses. We know that having a good marriage requires effort and hard work. At times, however, in the midst of that pain and struggle we can lose sight of what marriage is all about. We forget that we have made a cov e nant promise to love for better or worse. In the better times, love is usually easy. When worse comes, we often don&#x2019;t know <i>how </i>to continue to love when we are angry, hurt, scared, or don&#x2019;t <i>feel</i> very loving. We also aren&#x2019;t exactly sure what that kind of love is supposed to look like. Do we just forbear? Forgive and forget? How and when do we apply the bolder forms of love?<br><br>Research shows that we aren&#x2019;t doing very well with this struggle. Currently, the national divorce rate is slightly higher for those who claim to be &#x201c;born again&#x201d; than for the general population. Each day in my counseling practice I work with Christians who struggle in marriages that are unhappy or problematic. Ending a marriage that one finds difficult or unsatisfying is a real temptation. Christians opt for that path with increasing frequency even though they know, in most cases, that God desires them to stay in their marriage and work out the difficulties. Others stay married but in name only. Their hearts are cold toward their spouse and toward God, whom they think has ordered them to stay in a marriage they find too difficult.<br><br>Surely there must be a better alternative. In <i>How to Act Right When Your Spouse Acts Wrong</i>, you will begin to see yourself and your marriage through the lens of God&#x2019;s eternal purposes. You will learn how God uses the imperfections, differences, and sins of your spouse to help <i>you</i> grow to be more like Christ. This book will help you learn <i>how</i> to love and to <i>keep </i>your promises when it is hard. When you don&#x2019;t feel like it. When you are not getting much in return. And probably most important, this book will show you why this is good for you to learn.<br><br>It&#x2019;s been said that marriage isn&#x2019;t about finding the right person but about becoming the right person. I am humbled by the reality that I am still learning to be the kind of wife God calls me to be and the kind of wife my husband needs. I don&#x2019;t always act right or do right, especially when my husband disappoints me or fails me. But in the twentyfive years we have shared, I have learned to do it better and more consistently. Like some of you, I, too, have a long way to go, but I have gained some personal and professional wisdom over the years that may help make your journey more successful.<br><br>Unfortunately, these days I meet many who aren&#x2019;t looking for deep personal change or growth. Instead, they want a quick fix or relief from pain. People often say to me, &#x201c;Just tell me what I can do to make this better&#x2014;<i>now</i>!&#x201d; I recently gave a seminar on the subject of how to make your marriage happier. At the conclusion of my talk, audiotapes and books were available for those who were interested. Every item that dealt with ways to make yourself or your marriage happier was snapped up in minutes. Tapes and books about the deeper life and attaining spir it ual growth and maturity were left behind. Those subjects were less appealing to that crowd, yet God tells us that deepening our relationship with him is the very cornerstone to our well-being and happiness.<br><br>Learning to respond rightly when we are wronged and wounded takes maturity and wisdom&#x2014;and hard work. God is interested in developing the character of Christ within us. Merely learning some tricks or techniques will not be enough to deal with the heart issues that rise to the surface of our lives when our spouse doesn&#x2019;t act in the way we desire. Although the quick fix looks appealing, many of us have already learned (often the hard way) that the path that appears easiest turns out to be the more difficult in the long run.<br><br>Maturity and growth usually take place in the context of relationships. Right from the beginning of life, God places us into a family. Within this environment of family interaction we begin to experience love and conflict, joy and sadness, intimacy and alienation. Our parents help shape our character (in both positive and negative ways). We begin to define who we are to a large extent by how we interact with others. Are we kind? loyal? selfish? helpful? Do we think of others or only of ourselves? The people in our family help shape us, and our interaction with them exposes us. We can&#x2019;t pretend for long in the context of family. Conflicts, pain, disappointment, and anger often rip off our pleasant exterior persona and expose our uglier side.<br><br>If we have come to Christ through a conversion experience, we also have an interactive relationship with him. He gives us a new identity and purpose. He loves us with an everlasting love. He adopts us as his children, and he seeks to shape our character to become more and more like his. But that&#x2019;s not all. He puts us into another family&#x2014;the family of God. His Word instructs us how to treat one another, even when we are being treated unfairly. The daily environment of family life, both in the church and in our homes, reveals our weaknesses and sins. Although this is painful, it is ultimately a good thing. When we are exposed, we cannot deceive ourselves into thinking that we are something we are not. Exposure shows us (often in bold colors) the areas where we don&#x2019;t trust God fully and where God wants us to yield ourselves to him so that we might become more like Jesus.<br><br>When we speak of acting &#x201c;right,&#x201d; we must be careful not to think that what looks like the right response for a person with one type of marital difficulties is always the <i>right </i>response for another. When attempting to apply Scripture to life&#x2019;s troubles, many of us often reduce it to a rule book. It is much easier to have pat answers for all of life&#x2019;s difficulties. Yet life is not that simple, and God&#x2019;s Word is much richer than just a set of rules to live by. For example, some women have believed that when their husband mistreats them physically, emotionally, or sexually, they should obey God and become more like Christ by yielding to the abuse as an act of submission. One woman who had been taught this thought that Jesus wanted her to be &#x201c;led like a lamb to the slaughter.&#x201d; Perhaps acting right or acting like Christ in this marriage might involve a deeper and more accurate understanding of submission and headship. For this particular woman, loving her husband or acting right may require speaking up respectfully yet boldly against the evil in their marital relationship. It might mean she must learn to speak the truth about how God sees her husband&#x2019;s abusive behavior and how it is destroying their marriage. It may even involve exposing the deeds of darkness to others and allowing her spouse to experience the consequences of his sin in order to bring him to the possibility of repentance. I will be saying more in chapter 9 on how to respond correctly to the more difficult and sensitive marital problems.<br><br>To take this idea a step farther, what&#x2019;s right in one situation may be wrong in another. Someone whose spouse commits a grievous sin against him or her may need to speak up and boldly enforce consequences for destructive behaviors. On the other hand, many of us blurt out what we think our spouse is doing wrong without much thought or any prayer. Acting right may involve keeping quiet at times and accepting our spouse&#x2019;s weakness. Too often we take a cookie-cutter approach to solving marital difficulties and try to make answers that fit one type of problem work for a completely different situation. We would never respect a doctor who treated each patient the same way with the same surgical procedure or medication for every ailment. Neither can we take such a naive approach in learning to act right when our spouse acts wrong. Yet in all situations, God&#x2019;s Word calls us to holy actions bathed in loving attitudes.<br><br>Today we live in a culture that is more concerned with getting than giving. Over and over again in my counseling sessions I hear spouses complain, &#x201c;My needs aren&#x2019;t being met in my marriage.&#x201d; Dissatisfaction, anger, resentment, and bitterness are the mainstays in many homes because we go into marriage seeking what we can get out of it. Acting right when our spouse acts wrong will not necessarily guarantee a more satisfying marital relationship, although it often does. Acting right may not make our spouse turn around and change his or her ways or meet our needs, although it could. God says that we exert a powerful influence over others as we seek to lovingly interact with them. (See 1 Thessalonians 5:11; Hebrews 10:24-25; Proverbs 27:17.)<br><br>As we start learning how to act right when our spouse acts wrong, we will begin to see what God is doing to make us more like him in the midst of marital difficulties. We will become able to look at the idiosyncratic differences of our spouse less problematically and learn how to respond wisely when wronged. Perhaps most important of all, learning to act right when our spouse acts wrong will force us to forage for a deeper relationship with Christ. For to act right with a pure and sincere heart in the midst of suffering will stretch our faith and trust in God as we struggle to yield our will to his plan for our life.<br><br>The marriage relationship is a picture of our cov e nant relationship with Christ. He is going to be our teacher in this process, for he always acts right.<br><br>Even when we act wrong.</p></p><h2>The Secret of the Mansion</h2><p>Trixie Belden and her friends search for hidden treasure in a mysterious mansion owned by an old miser.</p><p>Trixie&#39;s summer is going to be sooo boring with her two older brothers away at camp.

He was, as Graham Greene declared, &#x201c;one of the best living American writers.&#x201d; Mr. Vonnegut passed away in April 2007.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br>Tiglath-Pileser<br>The Third . . .<br><br>My name is Howard W. Campbell, Jr.<br><br>I am an American by birth, a Nazi by reputation, and a nationless person by inclination.<br><br>The year in which I write this book is 1961.<br><br>I address this book of mine to Mr. Tuvia Friedmann, Director of the Haifa Institute for the Documentation of War Criminals, and to whomever else this may concern.<br><br>Why should this book interest Mr. Friedmann?<br><br>Because it is written by a man suspected of being a war criminal. Mr. Friedmann is a specialist in such persons. He had expressed an eagerness to have any writings I might care to add to his archives of Nazi villainy. He is so eager as to give me a typewriter, free stenographic service, and the use of research assistants, who will run down any facts I may need in order to make my account complete and accurate.<br><br>I am behind bars.<br><br>I am behind bars in a nice new jail in old Jerusalem.<br><br>I am awaiting a fair trail for my war crimes by the Republic of Israel.<br><br>It is a curious typewriter Mr. Friedmann has given to me--and an appropriate typewriter, too. It is a typewriter, too. It is a typewriter that was obviously made in Germany during the Second World War. How can I tell? Quite simply, for it puts at finger tips a symbol that was never used on a typewriter before the Third German Reich, a symbol that will never be used on a typewriter again.<br><br>The symbol is the twin lightning strokes used for the dreaded S.S., the Schutzstaffel, the most fanatical wing of Nazism.<br><br>I used such a typewriter in Germany all through the war. Whenever I had occasion to write of the Schutzstaffel, which I did often and with enthusiasm, I never abbreviated it as "S.S.," but always struck the typewriter key for the far more frightening and magical twin lightning strokes.<br><br>Ancient history.<br><br>I am surrounded by ancient history. Though the jail in which I rot is new, some of the stones in it, I'm told, were cut in the time of King Solomon.<br><br>And sometimes, when I look out through my cell window at the gay and brassy youth of the infant Republic of Israel, I feel that I and my war crimes are as ancient as Solomon's old gray stones.<br><br>How long ago that war, that Second World War, was! How long ago the crimes in it!<br><br>How nearly forgotten it is, even by the Jews--the young Jews, that is.<br><br>One of the Jews who guards me here knows nothing about that war. He is not interested. His name is Arnold Marx. He has very red hair. He is only eighteen, which means Arnold was three when Hitler died, and nonexistent when my career as a war criminal began.<br><br>He guards me from six in the morning until noon.<br><br>Arnold was born in Israel. He has never been outside of Israel.<br><br>His mother and father left Germany in the early thirties. His grandfather, he told me, won an Iron Cross in the First World War.<br><br>Arnold is studying to be a lawyer. The avocation of Arnold and of his father, a gunsmith, is archaeology. Father and son spend most all their spare time excavating the ruins of Hazor. They do so under the direction of Yigael Yadin, who was Chief of Staff of the Israeli Army during the war with the Arab States.<br><br>So be it.<br><br>Hazor, Arnold tells me, was a Canaanite city in northern Palestine that existed at least nineteen hundred years before Christ. About fourteen hundred years before Christ, Arnold tells me, an Israelite army captured Hazor, killed all forty thousand inhabitants, and burned it down.<br><br>"Solomon rebuilt the city," said Arnold, "but in 732 B.C. Tiglath-pileser the Third burned it down again."<br><br>"Who?" I said.<br><br>"Tiglath-pileser the Third," said Arnold. "The Assyrian," he said, giving my memory a nudge.<br><br>"Oh," I said. "That Tiglath-pileser."<br><br>"You act as though you never heard of him," said Arnold.<br><br>"I never have," I said. I shrugged humbly. "I guess that's pretty terrible."<br><br>"Well--" said Arnold, giving me a schoolmaster's frown, "it seems to me he really is somebody everybody ought to know about He was probably the most remarkable man the Assyrians ever produced."<br><br>"Oh," I said.<br><br>"I'll bring you a book about him, if you like," said Arnold.<br><br>"That's nice of you," I said. "Maybe I'll get around to thinking about remarkable Assyrians later on. Right now my mind is pretty well occupied with remarkable Germans."<br><br>"Like who?" he said.<br><br>"Oh, I've been thinking a lot lately about my old boss, Paul Joseph Goebbels," I said.<br><br>Arnold looked at me blankly. "Who?" he said.<br><br>And I felt the dust of the Holy Land creeping in to bury me, sensed how thick a dust-and-rubble blanket I would one day wear. I felt thirty or forty feet of ruined cities above me; beneath me some primitive kitchen middens, a temple or two--and then--<br><br>Tiglath-pileser the Third.<br><i><br>Chapter Two<br></i><br><br>Special Detail . . .<br><br>The guard who relieves Arnold Marx at noon each day is a man nearly my own age, which is forty-eight. He remembers the war, all right, though he doesn't like to.<br><br>His name is Andor Gutman. Andor is a sleepy, not very bright Estonian Jew. He spent two years in the extermination camp at Auschwitz. According to his own reluctant account, he came this close to going up a smokestack of a crematorium there:<br><br>"I had just been assigned to the Sonderkommando," he said to me, "when the order came from Himmler to close the ovens down."<br><br>Sonderkommando means special detail. At Auschwitz it meant a very special detail indeed--one composed of prisoners whose duties were to shepherd condemned persons into gas chambers, and then to lug their bodies out. When the job was done, the members of the Sonderkommando were themselves killed. The first duty of their successors was to dispose of their remains.<br><br>Gutman told me that many men actually volunteered for the Sonderkommando.<br><br>"Why?" I asked him.<br><br>"If you would write a book about that," he said, "and give the answer to that question, that &#x2018;Why?'--you would have a very great book."<br><br>"Do you know the answer?" I said.<br><br>"No," he said, "That is why I would pay a great deal of money for a book with the answer in it."<br><br>"Any guesses?" I said.<br><br>"No," he said, looking me straight in the eye, "even though I was one of the ones who volunteered."<br><br>He went away for a little while, after having confessed that. And he thought about Auschwitz, the thing he liked least to think about. And he came back, and he said to me:<br><br>"There were loudspeakers all over the camp," he said, "and they were never silent for long. There was much music played through them. Those who were musical told me it was often good music--sometimes the best."<br><br>"That's interesting," I said.<br><br>"There was no music by Jews," he said. "That was forbidden."<br><br>"Naturally," I said.<br><br>"And the music was always stopping in the middle," he said, "and then there was an announcement. All day long, music and announcements."<br><br>"Very modern," I said.<br><br>He closed his eyes, remembered gropingly. "There was one announcement that was always crooned, like a nursery rhyme. Many times a day it came. It was the call for the Sonderkommando."<br><br>"Oh?" I said.<br><br>"Leichent�rger zu Wache," he crooned, his eyes still closed.<br><br>Translation: "Corpse-carriers to the guardhouse." In an institution in which the purpose was to kill human beings by the millions, it was an understandably common cry.<br><br>"After two years of hearing that call over the loudspeakers, between the music," Gutman said to me, "the position of corpse-carrier suddenly sounded like a very good job."<br><br>"I can understand that," I said.<br><br>"You can?" he said. He shook his head. "I can't," he said. "I will always be ashamed. Volunteering for the Sonderkommando--it was a very shameful thing to do."<br><br>"I don't think so," I said.<br><br>"I do," he said. "Shameful," he said. "I never want to talk about it again."<br><i><br>Chapter Three</i><br>Briquets . . .<br><br>The guard who relieves Andor Gutman at six each night is Arpad Kovacs. Arpad is a Roman candle of a man, loud and gay.<br><br>When Arpad came on duty at six last night, he demanded to see what I'd written so far. I gave him the very few pages, and Arpad walked up and down the corridor, waving and praising the pages extravagantly.<br><br>He didn't read them. He praised them for what he imagined to be in them.<br><br>"Give it to the complacent bastards!" he said last night. "Tell those smug briquets!"<br><br>By briquets he meant people who did nothing to save their own lives or anybody else's life when the Nazis took over, who were willing to go meekly all the way to the gas chambers, if that was where the Nazis wanted them to go. A briquet, of course, is a molded block of coal dust, the soul of convenience where transportation, storage and combustion are concerned.<br><br>Arpad, faced with the problem of being a Jew in Nazi Hungary, did not become a briquet. On the contrary, Arpad got himself false papers and joined the Hungarian S.S.<br><br>That fact is the basis for his sympathy with me. "Tell them the things a man does to stay alive! What's so noble about being a briquet?" he said last night.<br><br>"Did you ever hear any of my broadcasts?" I asked him. The medium of my war crimes was radio broadcasting. I was a Nazi radio propagandist, a shrewd and loathsome anti-Semite.<br><br>"No," he said.<br><br>So I showed him a transcript of a broadcast, a transcript furnished to me by the Haifa Institute. "Read it," I said.<br><br>"I don't have to," He said. "Everybody was saying the same things over and over and over in those days."<br><br>"Read it anyway--as a favor," I said.<br><br>So he read it, his face becoming sourer and sourer. He handed it back to me. "You disappoint me," he said.<br><br>"Oh?" I said.<br><br>"It's so weak!" he said. "It has no body, no paprika, no zest! I though you were a master of racial invective!"<br><br>"I'm not?" I said.<br><br>"If any member of my S.S. platoon had spoken in such a friendly way about the Jews," said Arpad, "I would have had him shot for treason! Goebbels should have fired you and hired me as the radio scourge of the Jews. I would have raised blisters around the world!"<br><br>"You were already doing your part with your S.S. platoon," I said.<br><br>Arpad beamed, remembering his S.S. days. "What an Aryan I made!" he said.<br><br>"Nobody ever suspected you?" I said.<br><br>"How would they dare?" he said. "I was such a pure and terrifying Aryan that they even put me in a special detachment. Its mission was to find out how the Jews always knew what the S.S. was going to do next. There was a leak somewhere, and we were out to stop it." He looked bitter and affronted, remembering it, even though he had been that leak.<br><br>"Was the detachment successful in its mission?" I said.<br><br>"I'm happy to say," said Arpad, "that fourteen S.S. men were shot on our recommendations. Adolf Eichmann himself congratulated us."<br><br>"You met him, did you?" I said.<br><br>"Yes--" said Arpad, "and I'm sorry I didn't know at the time how important he was."<br><br>"Why?" I said.<br><br>"I would have killed him," said Arpad.</p><h2>The Case of Hermie the Missing Hamster (Jigsaw Jones Mystery, No. 1)</h2><p>The clever, puzzle-crazy Jigsaw Jones utilizes his Top Secret Detective Journal and enlists the help of his ace partner, Mila, to track down the missing hamster, Hermie.

In this controversial and definitive study Hogue examines St. Malachy and other gifted saints, popes, monks, and nuns who have been responsible for a covert tradition of prophecy that the Vatican has never officially acknowledged. "The Last Pope" is a unique prophetic examination of papal history--past and future.

Hogue integrates prophecy and history like a master fencer wields a rapier and dagger, adding just a touch of wry humor--who else but Hogue would compare Saint Bernard and the 12th-century monastic movement to Elvis Presley and rock 'n' roll? <i>The Last Pope</i> succeeds on many levels: as a comprehensive history of the papacy, as an examination of the prophecy of Saint Malachy, and as an assessment of the history and potential future of Catholicism. <i>--Brian Patterson</i>John Hogue is the author of the best-selling Messiahs, Nostradamus: The New Revelations and Nostradamus: The Complete Prophecies.

Very Good conditions. May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p></p><h2>The Weight of Dreams</h2><p>At seventeen, Ty Bonte's life revolves around the seasons and the work to be done on his father's Nebraska Sandhills ranch. Long abandoned by his mother for the comforts of town life, Ty learns from his father that violence is as much a part of being a man as hard work. When he and his drinking buddy Harney Rivers, beat up two young Indians from the nearby Rosebud Reservation and leave them to die, Ty flees from home and the arrest warrant that has been issued for their crime.<br>Ty settles in Kansas, making a quiet but good living as a horse trader. Reinventing himself as his own kind of man, he tries to forget his past - the sudden death of his brother, the rejection by his mother, the drunken beatings by his father, and the night he and Harney drove onto the Rosebud Reservation. He takes in Dakota Carlyle, a woman who seems to find solace in horses but rarely in people and who has her own past. But before Ty and Dakota have a chance to make a life for themselves, Harney Rivers suddenly reappears and commits an act of shattering brutality that forces Ty to return to Nebraska. His quest for retribution, resolution, and redemption culminates in a furious and mesmerzing courtroom battle between the two men.</p><p>In her earlier novel <i>South of Resurrection</i>, Jonis Agee seemed bent on refuting Thomas Wolfe: you can go home again, though sometimes it's easier not to. <i>The Weight of Dreams</i> finds her returning to the same thematic territory in a sweeping, ambitious novel about nothing less than good and evil, writ on a vast Western scale. Home, for Ty Bonte, is the hardscrabble Nebraska Sandhills, where he's been doing "a man's work" on the family ranch since the age of 8. Unfortunately, he's also been taking a man's share of punishment--his mother's abandonment, his father's abuse, even his own guilt over his baby brother's accidental death. Small wonder, then, that Ty turns into something of a delinquent, especially when he joins forces with Harney Rivers. Rich kid, sadist, drug dealer--"the boy who could put his hands on anything illegal"--Harney gets Ty into even more trouble than he could on his own. When they pick up a pair of Indian hitchhikers one bitterly cold winter night, the violence that subsequently erupts will change all four of their lives forever. <p> Twenty years later, Ty is living in Kansas, where he owns a small, hard-won farm and trades horses for a living. He's made a sober, reasonably successful life for himself, but is still haunted by the repercussions of his past--which include an outstanding warrant for his arrest. Then one day Ty picks up a mysterious woman named Dakota along with a load of horses, and the past comes knocking on his door in the form of Harney Rivers. Before the novel is through, Ty will have to make amends for the crimes of his youth--and in the process, redefine what it means to go home. Gritty depictions of ranch life; lyrical evocations of the stark Nebraska landscape; a romance that feels both passionate and true: there is much to admire here, even when the entire package feels somewhat overlong. For one thing, Agee evokes the horse life so vividly that you can practically smell it--and among her characters, only the impossibly evil Harney comes off as less than true-to-life. In the end, flaws like these count for little when weighed against Agee's vivid portrait of place. <i>--Chloe Byrne</i></p>&#34;The Weight of Dreams is a book you&#39;ll want to sink into, its vast and rich landscapes, its broken and hopeful characters, its broad reach through time and space, and every hidden corner of the human heart. Jonis Agee tells this story with consonance and generosity, a finely tuned ear and the spirit a swild as a Sand Hills horse.&#34; --- Pam Houston, author of Cowboys Are My Weakness</p><h2>Seven Dials (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)</h2><p>Thomas Pitt, mainstay of Her Majesty&#x2019;s Special Branch, is summoned to Connaught Square mansion where the body of a junior diplomat lies huddled in a wheelbarrow. Nearby stands the tenant of the house, the beautiful and notorious Egyptian woman Ayesha Zakhari, who falls under the shadow of suspicion. Pitt&#x2019;s orders are to protect&#x2014;at all costs&#x2014;the good name of the third person in the garden: senior cabinet minister Saville Ryerson. This distinguished public servant, whispered to be Ayesha&#x2019;s lover, insists that she is as innocent as Pitt himself is. Pitt&#x2019;s journey to uncover the truth takes him from Egyptian cotton fields to the insidious London slum called Seven Dials, to a packed London courtroom where shocking secrets will at last be revealed.</p><p>London detective Thomas Pitt is investigating the murder of a junior diplomat by a notorious Egyptian woman and her lover, a senior Cabinet minister involved in negotiating the conflict between Egypt's cotton growers and England's textile industry. Lovat, the diplomat, once served in Egypt, and to unravel the mystery of his death, Pitt travels to Alexandria, where he finds that the beautiful Ayesha Zakhari is not who she appears to be--and that Lovat's murder may be tied to an old crime which, if exposed, could set the Middle East aflame. While Pitt is in Egypt, his wife, Charlotte, occupies herself with a more mundane matter--the disappearance of a valet whose sister is a friend of the Pitt's housemaid. It's not long before the reader realizes the connection between the two crimes; meanwhile, Perry layers this smoothly plotted mystery with a fascinating history of Egypt in the days of the British Empire and the religious and economic tensions whose repercussions still resonate more than a century later. Perry, the author of two Victorian-era series (the other stars investigator William Monk), does her usual fine job of bringing the colorful time period alive, helped along by the details of domestic life provided by her protagonists' wives, interesting and accomplished women who have lately played all but equal roles in solving their husbands' cases. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>&#x201c;An Anne Perry novel is a delight to read as much for its Victorian-era details as for the mystery it unfolds.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>Chicago Tribune<br><br></i>&#x201c;A MASTER OF CRIME FICTION.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2013;The Baltimore Sun<br></i></b><br><b><br>Praise for Anne Perry&#x2019;s previous<br>Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novel<br><i>Southampton Row</i><br></b><br>&#x201c;Compelling and provocative . . .

A darkly funny tale of passion, romance, and sexy-time! Once you go chrome, you never go home!</p><p>"SHMOBOTS is really an awesome read." - <b>Project Fanboy</b>This hilarious graphic novel shows a futuristic society where robots were created to do the dirty work, only they were built by the lowest bidder, creating a race of metallic slackers&#x2014;the shmobots. Rusty, Eyeballs, 69.5 and their human friend Miles sit around, drink beer, attempt to have a band and get cut-rate lap dances. Meanwhile, a shmobot serial killer is on the loose. The art (like the cars) has a '70s feel of hotel sleaze and cop drama. In one scene, the three mechanical characters remove their sexual organs, and we find that 69.5's has to be screwed on. Later, their robot dog, Clinky, tries to hump a jukebox. The humor is prurient, the subject matter is adult, but what makes it nifty is the whacked-out camaraderie of the four sentient, male beings. A killer's on the loose, but they're more concerned with TV. Corroded bee-otch!! Rusty yells at a robot prostitute who spurns them. It's total I-don't-care culture, and Miles, as the one who is supposed to grow up, can't. Meanwhile, Rusty, in his halfhearted attempts to keep the group together, does mature (a bit). Sometimes the parodies edge on stereotypes about minorities, but the plot whips along and delivers some dastardly fun. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Original.</p><p>The latest in Linda Lael Miller's Springwater series, <i>A Springwater Christmas</i> introduces a boarding house spinster and a prodigal son to the mix of loveable characters in this frontier town. <p> Miss Olivia Darling seizes her first and last opportunity for adventure when she uses her inheritance from her late aunt to buy a boarding house. Her courage starts to falter, however, when all the customers steer straight for the rival McCafferys' hotel. When a tall, handsome stranger darkens her door, Olivia is instantly attracted to him.

It uses the latest scientific knowledge to recreate hundreds of ancient species, from some very early, alien-looking creatures to the great dinosaurs and early mammals. With thousands of photos, drawings and illustrations With an extensive catalog at its heart, Prehistoric Life profiles hundreds of fascinating species in incredible detail. The story starts in earnest 3.8 billion years ago, with the earliest-known form of life on Earth, a bacterium that still exists today, and journeys through action-packed millennia, charting the appearance of new life forms as well as devastating extinction events. Of course, the ever-popular and endlessly intriguing dinosaurs feature large, but Prehistoric Life gives you the whole picture, and the plants, invertebrates, amphibians, birds, reptiles, and mammals that are the ancestors of today&#39;s species also populate its pages, making this book unprecedented in its coverage of prehistory. Specially commissioned artworks use cutting-edge technology to render species in breathtakingly realistic fashion, with astonishing images of prehistoric remains, such as skeletons and fossils, to complete the story. To put all the evidence in context, the concept of geological time is explored, as is the classification of species and how the evidence for their evolution is preserved and can be deciphered. 12&#34; by 10&#34; Gold gilded pages</p><p></p><h2>THE MOUNTAINS OF TIBET</h2><p>A Tibetan woodcutter dreams of exploring the world, but is too busy with his life to ever leave his valley. After he dies, he is taken on a journey through the cosmos and all the places on Earth as he makes choices that lead him to a new life.</p><p><p>Mordicai Gerstein is the author and illustrator of many beloved books for children. He won the 2004 Caldecott Medal for <em>The Man Who Walked Between the Towers</em> and is also a painter, sculptor, and prizewinning designer and director of animated films. Mordicai Gerstein lives in western Massachusetts with his wife, Susan Yard Harris, who is also an illustrator, and their daughter, Risa. </p>Grade 2 Up This story of the death and reincarnation of a Tibetan woodcutter is a beautifully gentle look at one human being dealing with life's choices and possibilities. As a boy, he thought about other worlds that he would someday visit; as a man, he thought of other countries and people, yet ``he was always busy with his work and his wife and children.'' After his death, he is given the option of being part of ``the endless universe some call heaven'' or living another life, and he chooses another life. The choices which follow take him through all the galaxies, stars, planets, creatures, peoples, countries, and parents before arriving at the final twist in this journey back to where he had beenalmost. Thus, the story comes full circle. The quiet, rhythmic text is in perfect unity with the softly colored but radiant watercolor and gouache illustrations, leaving readers with a sense of wholeness and resolution. The golden borders neatly tuck the story in and add to its feeling of satisfaction and quiet joy. The real world scenes are in neatly boxed frames while the worlds of possibilities are displayed in mandala-like circular drawings. The main character, pictured in his small personal mandala, shows a range of emotions and dance-like movement. The kites held by the children in three scenes connect the multiple worlds of the story, providing both a grounding in the world we know and a means to soar beyond it. Children will appreciate the well-told tale and the joyous satisfaction of being one's own self in a large and magical world. Kay E.

The second book of the series, A Knight of the Word, raised expectations even higher. Now, in Angel Fire East, sure to be hailed as his most ambitious, most accomplished work yet, Terry Brooks brings his bestselling epic trilogy of good and evil to an unforgettable close.<br><br>As a Knight of the Word, John Ross has struggled against the tireless dark forces of the Void for twenty-five years. A rootless wanderer scarred as deeply by the magic he wields as by the unspeakable horrors he has witnessed in its service, Ross is driven by dreams that show the world reduced to blood and ashes by the Void and its minions. The grim futures he dreams each night will come true unless he can stop them now, in the present. But for all his power, John Ross is only one man, while the demons he hunts--and which hunt him in turn--are legion.<br><br>Then Ross learns of the birth of a gypsy morph, a rare and dangerous creature formed of wild magics spontaneously knit together. If he can discover its secret, the morph could be an invaluable weapon against the Void. But the Void, too, knows the value of the morph, and will not rest until the creature has been corrupted--or destroyed. <br><br>Desperate, Ross returns to the town of Hopewell, Illinois, home of Nest Freemark, a young woman with magical abilities of her own. Twice before, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance, the lives of Ross and Nest have intersected. Together, they have prevailed.<br><br>But now they face an ancient evil beyond anything they have ever encountered, for a demon of ruthless intelligence and feral cunning awaits them in Hopewell. As a firestorm of good and evil erupts, threatening to consume lives and shatter dreams, Ross and Nest have but a single chance to solve the mystery of the gypsy morph--and of their own profound connection.</p><p><i>Angel Fire East</i> marks the close of Terry Brooks's Nest Freemark-John Ross saga, which began with 1997's <i>Running with the Demon</i>. After a long layover in Seattle for the middle book, <i>Knight of the Word</i>, the fantasy-meets-modernity action returns to Nest's native Hopewell, where once again Nest and John must face off against the Void, this time in the form of ancient demon Findo Gask, who favors a black-clad evil preacher getup for his menacing needs.<p> Brooks's well-realized and likable cast from the previous books is back, from Nest (now 29) to Ross (haggard as ever) to Pick (still just a few inches tall) and even grown-up versions of Nest's childhood friends from <i>Running</i>, including Bennett, now a junkie with child. Of course, Findo Gask has assembled a creepy little Legion of Doom to harry these nice folks: a giant albino demon; a formless, flesh-eating <i>ur'droch</i>; and a knife-wielding Orphan-Annie-gone-bad named Penny Dreadful. And <i>Angel Fire</i>'s main plot thread is even compelling: John Ross has caught a shape-changing, wild-magic creature of enormous power, a gypsy morph, that he and Nest must discover how to turn to the Word before Gask and his crew can capture it for the Void.</p><p> But as with <i>Knight of the Word</i>, wooden pacing and unconvincing transitions keep this tale from rising to the level of Brooks's previous masterworks, such as the excellent Shannara and Landover series. If you've read the first two books, it's certainly worth seeing off your old friends in <i>Angel Fire East</i>. But if you're--heaven forbid--new to Terry Brooks, check out his earlier work, or even his very capable novelization of <i>Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</i>. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>"Terry Brooks is one of a handful of fantasy writers whose work consistently meets the highest literary standards."<br>--Rocky Mountain News</p><h2>Aunt Dimity&#39;s Christmas</h2><p>Lori Shepard&#39;s well-laid plans for holiday bliss are shattered when a mysterious stranger collapses in the driveway of her English cottage before Christmas and she teams up with a handsome Roman Catholic priest to solve the riddle of this John Doe&#39;s identity. 20,000 first printing.

The first book in the series, <em>Aunt Dimitys Death</em>, was voted One of the Centurys 100 Favorite Mysteries by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. She lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado.Lori Shepherd lives in England, in the village of Finch, with husband Bill and nine-month twins. She owns her pretty cottage and a considerable fortune besidesa legacy from her mother's long-dead friend Dimity Westwood, who still gives advice and support via ghostly writing in a blue leather journal (Aunt Dimity Digs In, 1998, etc.). Christmas is near and Lori is deep in elaborate preparations when, one snowy morning, a man is found on the ground outsideskeletal, shabbily dressed, and barely alive. Airlifted to the nearest hospital, he shows few signs of recovery, but Lori is intrigued, not to say obsessed, by the mystery of his appearance and is determined to ferret out his identity. Her interest is shared by Father Julian Bright, a local priest who runs St. Benedict's Homeless Shelter. Christmas plans take a back seat as Lori and Julian track their quarry back through a series of men's sheltersall near WWII bomber bases. What is the connection to the war medals and ribbons found with the derelict? Finally, research helpers bring Julian and Lori to London and the home of Lady Haverford, daughter of bomber hero Sir Miles Anscombe and sister of Christopher, the ailing tramp. She refuses to help her brother and accuses him of having driven their father to suicide. Back in Finch, Lori finds that her neighbors have done all the work for her Christmas party and that Aunt Dimity is eager to provide answers to all her unanswered questions, leaving Lori to contemplate some major changes in her own life. Interesting ideas narrated in a bright, literate style, but burdened by much treacly preaching and an obsession that remains unconvincing throughout. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Especially after I got fired from my first job. I was an editorial assistant at Jewcy, a website about Jewish stuff that was supposed to reach cool young people but ended up not reaching a large audience at all and shut down before being relaunched by people who could find an actual audience for the thing. My job involved sitting in a cramped office, filing invoices, and assisting someone who was sort of weird and not particularly warm. This was New Media 101, and I got the $400-a-week paycheck, benefits not included, to show for it. I&#x2019;m pretty sure that even though this was the kind of real, high-value work college is supposed to groom you for, I made less than I did at my high school hostess job at a Tex-Mex chain. Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who was fired from Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar, once said everyone should get fired once because &#x201c;it&#x2019;s a great learning experience.&#x201d; I agree: you should get fired once because it is a great learning experience. For instance, if you didn&#x2019;t grow up buying full-price Pucci like a socialite, you might have to learn how to live on the same amount of money your employed friends spend on lattes.<br> <br>It also, theoretically, teaches you how not to get fired again.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a good chance that getting fired will be the best thing that ever happened to you. No matter how excited I&#x2019;ve been to quit a job and move on to the next, I&#x2019;ve always been terrified to quit. When I hostessed at that local Tex-Mex joint, the restaurant manager knew I would quit when I left for college, yet still I was nervous to tell him I was leaving. Having the unpleasant &#x201c;I quit&#x201d; conversation feels like telling someone, &#x201c;No one likes you.&#x201d; So a boss asking you to leave a job&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s probably one you hate; most people who get fired don&#x2019;t love the thing they&#x2019;re getting fired from (How could you? They&#x2019;re firing you!)&#x2014;only saves you the extreme awkwardness of actually quitting. It also forces you to find something better as quickly as possible, instead of pussyfooting around about your job search because you&#x2019;ve settled into a routine of G-chatting for six hours a day and doing work for just two, while making enough money to afford Bravo, possibly also HBO.<br> <br>I was pretty lucky because after I got fired from Jewcy, I assisted, reported, and wrote five-sentence-long magazine articles as a freelancer for several months, and then New York magazine hired me to start its fashion blog, the Cut. This was the terrifying beginning of my career as a fashion journalist.<br> <br>I should say this job didn&#x2019;t just fall from the sky and into my lap. That&#x2019;s just not how opportunities work, unless you are Paris Hilton in 2005 (which is not an advisable situation anyway, since you&#x2019;d have to go everywhere wearing a neon loincloth and clear stilettos). I had been running around Manhattan asking celebrities awkward questions at cocktail parties as a freelance party reporter for New York magazine. Picture a girl in T. J. Maxx trying to interrupt Elle Macpherson&#x2019;s conversation in the middle of the private lounge of a $500-a-night hotel. (Macpherson must have sensed my deep longing to interview her about summer flings, the subject of the film we were feting, because as soon as she finished with her conversation, she turned and fled.) I had been doing this for nearly a year, so New York magazine had a sense of my skills. Also, I had a competing offer to run another fashion blog, which I told them about in hopes they&#x2019;d offer me a full-time job. Voil�. As soon as someone else wanted me, they decided to consider me for their top-secret fashion blogger position. Pro tip: the best way to make someone want you is to make someone else want you more.<br> <br>Just hours after I told my party-reporting editor about the competing offer, the editor of NYmag.com called me and said something like, &#x201c;We want to start a fashion blog. Do you want to try out to be our fashion blogger?&#x201d; He may as well have asked me if, moving forward, I&#x2019;d like to get around town exclusively by unicorn. Oh! Oh! Yes, I do! I do I do!!! I could not believe that I had been offered a full-time job at NYmag.com, a highly respected publication. I was so afraid of becoming a failure that to have any work, much less an absolute dream writing job at the only magazine I was dying to work for, felt unreal. Even if I would be blogging about fashion.<br> <br>&#x201c;I would be interested in that, yes,&#x201d; I said into the phone using my spa voice. I happened to be rushing through SoHo to crash a friend&#x2019;s midmorning kickboxing class with an expired guest pass. I felt like one of those highly enviable ladies who run around wearing yoga outfits in the middle of the day because instead of office work, they take barre class and buy kale at Whole Foods. But now, with an audition to become New York magazine&#x2019;s first fashion blogger, I turned right around and climbed back up the six flights of stairs to my apartment to hunker down with my cat and The View (poor man&#x2019;s barre class) to start working.<br> <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br> <br>At this point in my career, I felt fairly confident in my fashion knowledge because I had interviewed Tim Gunn a few times and had seen every episode of Project Runway. This&#x2014;along with searching &#x201c;fashion&#x201d; in Google News&#x2014;surely gave me the credentials I needed to complete the writing samples I had to turn in as my tryout for the role. I would later learn I knew absolutely nothing about fashion. Or blogging. But somehow, I faked my way through the interview process well enough to get a job offer. I tried to be all calm and cool about it when I got the call.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, thanks so much,&#x201d; I said, reverting to spa voice. &#x201c;Can I think it over and call you back?&#x201d;<br> <br>Then I called my parents to shout, &#x201c;OH MY GOD I GOT IT! THE JOB EVERY GIRL WOULD KILL FOR! [INSERT MORE THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA REFERENCES]!!!!&#x201d; This was a dream. The royal wedding of jobs. All those awkward celebrity encounters had finally gotten me somewhere! And also: fuck that dickhead who fired me!<br> <br>Something like three minutes later, I just couldn&#x2019;t take it any longer and lunged toward the phone. I had this odd feeling that if I didn&#x2019;t say yes it might go away. &#x201c;I accept!!!&#x201d; I told my future editor, now on the edge of hysteria. I&#x2019;ve since learned that job offers �aren&#x2019;t like people you&#x2019;ve slept with or cupcakes&#x2014;they do not just disappear. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to tell the people I was working with at Cond� Nast Traveler, where I had recently accepted a freelance three-day-a-week job assisting the sole web editor, that I had to quit to go become NYmag.com&#x2019;s first fashion blogger. The vocally fashion-�obsessed editorial assistant who sat behind me and acted like I didn&#x2019;t exist would be shocked. The glee this filled me with was almost enough to counteract the nervousness I had about my writing abilities: how was I ever going to be as good or funny every single day as the existing and enormously talented NYmag.com blogging team?<br> <br>I started my coveted fashion blogging job at NYmag.com in February 2008, right before Fall Fashion Week. &#x201c;What an exciting time to start!&#x201d; everyone said. Well, no&#x2014;what a terrifying time to start. I had two days to learn everything about fashion, and blogging. I can&#x2019;t even memorize a Britney Spears song in two days.<br> <br>People who wrote for the internet, referred to broadly at the time as &#x201c;bloggers,&#x201d; were just beginning to earn legitimacy in the fashion world. On January 31, 2008, the New York Times published a story about the rise of beauty bloggers, boldly stating, &#x201c;the cosmetics industry has stopped seeing bloggers as bottom feeders.&#x201d; (Of course, this feels hilarious now that beauty vloggers are millionaires&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. )<br> <br>The same was true for some fashion bloggers. The term can apply to all kinds of different people, many of whose worth was debated intensely. Fashion bloggers are like the global warming of the fashion industry&#x2014;their impact only selectively acknowledged despite their undeniable existence. At this time, a debate was raging in the fashion industry about a blogger&#x2019;s place in the industry. Did they deserve the front-row seats they had started getting? Most famously, Bryanboy sat front row at a Dolce &amp; Gabbana show with a laptop, which really sent people into a frenzy. But not long after that, when then thirteen-year-old fashion blogger Tavi Gevinson sat&nbsp;front row at the Dior Couture show (wearing a gigantic, �view-�obstructing bow on her head, no less), the raised eyebrows turned to outright vitriol. Industry lifers couldn&#x2019;t understand how a teenager could burst onto the scene with a website, a dream, and a cute outfit and be awarded status they believed it should take decades to earn. Yet, you can see how easy it is to get confused about bloggers, firstly because it&#x2019;s confusing that taking photos of oneself wearing clothes now translates to, for a very lucky few, a lucrative career path. But this is only one kind of fashion blogger, for a few varieties exist:<br> <br>1. Journalists who happen to write for blogs. This is my category. I&#x2019;m a journalist whose medium happens to be the internet&#x2014;a &#x201c;blog,&#x201d; or &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; (fancy name for &#x201c;section of a website that probably has its own tab at the top&#x201d;).<br> <br>2. Personal-style bloggers. The people who post to the internet photos of themselves wearing clothes. The most fully formed �personal-style blogs also treat viewers to a broader look at their subjects&#x2019; lives. Think: photos of the inside of a hotel room, closet porn, this vintage store I went to this one time, cupcakes I thought were really pretty. These bloggers are bang-up stylists, own the best clothes, and eat the best baked goods, and I am jealous of all of them.<br> <br>3. Fashion fans who chronicle their fandom online. Due to the independent nature of their sites, bloggers can create their own journalistic standards. Whereas many news outlets have rules about not accepting expensive gifts or free trips, independent bloggers can accept as many free gifts and trips as they want (if a blogger reviews a product they receive for free, FTC regulations require that the blogger disclose the product was a gift). The more gifts they get, the better off they are, because who running an indie website really has the money to fly to S�o Paolo Fashion Week? And if you&#x2019;re in the business of sharing photos of yourself wearing clothes and aren&#x2019;t independently wealthy, where would you be without free or heavily discounted clothes with which to continually update your look? For this type of blogger, the consequence of receiving so much free stuff is that you pretty much have to cover all of it favorably or only feature stuff you truly love. So you end up with a fan site. I don&#x2019;t see this as much different from fashion magazines like Vogue or Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar that primarily promote the goods of their advertisers and cover things they love in the most&#x2014;if at times, painfully&#x2014;positive fashion. These sites are often very personality driven, even if they&#x2019;re not solely about how a certain person dresses.<br> <br>4. Instagram &#x201c;celebs.&#x201d; People with half a million followers, who are known better for that than anything else. They might have a blog, too, but their agents (because fashion blogging has become so weirdly lucrative and fame making, it now requires agents) tout their impressively robust Instagram followings as chief among their talents.<br> <br>5. Street-style photographers. The most famous street-style photographers, like Phil Oh, Scott &#x201c;the Sartorialist&#x201d; Schuman, and Tommy Ton, got their start by posting to their own sites photos they took of people wearing outfits. Though photographers of their caliber now get a lot of high-paying commercial work, they&#x2019;re still called bloggers because they still update their websites&#x2014;the main reason they came to be known in the first place. But they&#x2019;re really not bloggers in my mind so much as photojournalists. And they&#x2019;ve become remarkably powerful&#x2014;they sit front row at shows and get paid tens of thousands of dollars and up to shoot major ad campaigns. What&#x2019;s more, getting photographed by one of them has become a true accomplishment. Wearing an oversized angora coat and man loafers to a fashion show, catching the eye of the Sartorialist, getting photographed by him, and then seeing your photo land on his site is the street-style version of admission to Harvard. An irrefutable nod to your utmost talent in dressing yourself.<br> <br>The distinction between bloggers (the lesser) and other print media people (more legitimate, allegedly) is not only disappearing but actually reversing. Whereas they used to begrudgingly award bloggers and vloggers standing tickets and didn&#x2019;t care about that thing called Instagram, now brands practically beg internet stars to show up to events and fashion shows and Instagram something&#x2014;anything! If a PR person overhears you saying &#x201c;That tiny coffee cup is cute; we should Instagram that!&#x201d; they will come running up to you and ask if a waiter can bring one over on a private tray with its own thumbnail-sized coordinating donut. Practically every professional writer and photographer in the world now works on something that could qualify as a blog and, therefore, could be categorized as a blogger. It&#x2019;s impossible to work in media in any form now and not put your work on the internet in some way. Yet at the same time, putting myself and the Blonde Salad (yes, that&#x2019;s a real personal-style blogger) and Phil Oh in the same category is like seeing dolphins and whales and mermaids jumping around in the ocean and calling them all &#x201c;fish.&#x201d;<br> <br>We need to implement new distinctions for &#x201c;new media&#x201d; people. As much I would like it to be my job, I am never going to succeed in making a career out of posting photos of myself wearing different outfits for people to enthuse over on the internet.<br> <br>As for my personal style, it progressed slower than the speed of fossilization. When I started at the Cut, I knew as much about fashion as I did about gardening. Just as I knew soil is required to grow vegetables, some of which grow aboveground and some of which grow belowground, I knew that people wear clothes. I knew that really expensive ones with price tags affixed to labels by leather strings were more likely to be considered &#x201c;fashion&#x201d; than Jeggings with clear MMMMMMMM stickers running down the legs. For months when I started, I would get up before seven each morning so that I could read every word in Women&#x2019;s Wear Daily to figure out what mattered the most in the fashion world that day. I could read enough to learn about the fashion business and how it worked and all that. I could figure out which designers worked at which labels, which labels people cared about the most, and what the trends were in everything from online retail strategy to spring denim. But I could not nearly as easily adopt a sense of personal style that said, &#x201c;I am a person who understands fashion and excels at getting dressed. Do worship my choice of blouse.&#x201d; I was very cavelady about it: &#x201c;This is shirt, this is pants, this is outfit.&#x201d; I used to wear this one white knit top with a tattoo print-esque design on it (shhh!) that had three-quarter-length bell sleeves. I had not yet switched to skinny jeans, so I wore said top with boot-cut Abercrombie jeans I&#x2019;d owned since high school&#x2014;the &#x201c;worn in&#x201d; kind that looked like they had been used as a rag to wash hippos before they became pants. (This was the hot look ...</p><h2>A High Wind in Jamaica</h2><p>A group of children, five Bas-Thorntans and two Fernandezes, sail away from hurricane-ravaged Jamaica towards safety in England, only to be captured by pirates</p><p><i>A High Wind in Jamaica</i> is not so much a book as a curious object, like a piece of driftwood torqued into an alarming shape from years at sea. And like driftwood, it seems not to have been made, exactly, but simply to have come into being, so perfectly is its form married to its content. The five Bas-Thornton children must leave their parents in Jamaica after a terrible hurricane blows down their family home. Accompanied by their Creole friends, the Fernandez children, they board a ship that is almost immediately set upon by pirates. The children take to corsair life coolly and matter-of-factly; just as coolly do they commit horrible deeds, and have horrible deeds visited upon them. First published in 1929, <i>A High Wind in Jamaica</i> has been compared to <i>Lord of the Flies</i> in its unflinching portrayal of innocence corrupted, but Richard Hughes is the supreme ironist William Golding never was. He possesses the ability to be one moment thoroughly inside a character's head, and the next outside of it altogether, hilariously commenting.<p> Irony finds a happy home indeed in the book's mixture of the macabre and the adorable. The baby girl, Rachel, "could even sum up maternal feelings for a marline-spike, and would sit up aloft rocking it in her arms and crooning. The sailors avoided walking underneath: for such an infant, if dropped from a height, will find its way through the thickest skull (an accident which sometimes befalls unpopular captains)." In that "such an infant" lies a world of mordant wit. In fact, throughout, Hughes's wildly eccentric punctuation and startling syntax make just the right verbal vehicle for this dark-hearted pirate story for grownups.</p><p> Hughes enjoys some coy riffing on the child mind, as with this description of the way Emily handles an uncomfortable social situation: "Much the best way of escaping from an embarrassing rencontre, when to walk away would be an impossible strain on the nerves, is to retire in a series of somersaults. Emily immediately started turning head over heels up the deck." Even so, Hughes never sentimentalizes his subject: "Babies of course are not human--they are animals, and have a very ancient and ramified culture, as cats have, and fishes, and even snakes." Children, as a race, are given rough treatment: "their minds are not just more ignorant and stupider than ours, but differ in kind of thinking (are <i>mad</i>, in fact)." That madness is here isolated, prodded, and poked to chilling effect. But Hughes never loses sight of his ultimate objective: <i>A High Wind in Jamaica</i> is, above all, a cracking good yarn. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>New edition of a classic adventure novel and one of the most startling, highly praised stories in English literature--a brilliant chronicle of two sensitive children&#39;s violent voyage from innocence to experience.</p><h2>The Mediterranean in History</h2><p>Contained in this history of the "Great Sea" are the stories of the birth of Western Civilization, the clash of warring faiths, and the rivalries of empires.<br> David Abulafia leads a team of eight distinguished historians in an exploration of the great facts, themes and epochs of this region's history: the physical setting; the rivalry between Carthaginians, Greeks, and Etruscans for control of the sea routes; unification under Rome and the subsequent break up into Western Christendom, Byzantium, and Islam; the Crusades; commerce in medieval times; the Ottoman resurgence; the rivalry of European powers from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries; and the globalization of the region in the last century.<br> The book departs from the traditional view of Mediterranean history, which placed emphasis on the overwhelming influences of physical geography on the molding of the region's civilizations. Instead, this new interpretation regards that physical context as a staging ground for decisive action, and at center stage are human catalysts at all levels of society-whether great kings and emperors, the sailors of medieval Amalfi, or the Sephardic Jews who were expelled from Spain in 1492. The authors do more than simply catalogue the societies that developed in the region, but also describe how these groups interacted with one another across the sea, enjoying commercial and political ties as well as sharing ideas and religious beliefs.<br> This richly illustrated book offers contemporary historical writing at its best and is sure to engage specialists, students, and general readers alike.</p><p>David Abulafia, Professor of Mediterranean Studies, Cambridge University.This is a lushly illustrated, sweeping overview of the Mediterranean region by eight historians. Each writes about a specific period, but all describe the sea as the most important feature of the area, where the beguilingly varied cultures have lined the coasts, appearing and vanishing over the centuries, and have traded and warred with each other. Except for Egyptian civilization, self-contained and usually safe in the Nile Valley, the Mediterranean presented both danger and opportunity--the fact that the Romans were the only ones to ever unify it shows how susceptible it has been to shifts in power, especially naval power, which is presented as a history-making factor in every writer's essay, as is another historical constant: the geographical and climatic environment. Within these structures, the authors depict the daily workings of commerce and the conflicts of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, their observations always accentuated by photographs and drawings.

Original.</p><p>Ann Tatlock is a full-time writer who has also worked as an assistant editor for Decision Magazine. A graduate of Oral Roberts University with an M.A. in Communications from Wheaton College Graduate School, she has published numerous articles. All the Way Home is her third novel. She and her husband, Bob, along with their daughter, Laura Jane, live in Minneapolis, Minnesota."This is a moving and wonderfully encouraging novel...one of the most realistic and significant ones I've read, and one that leaves a great inspiration and message of trust in God for the outcome of all things...I highly recommend it."<br> -- Renownmagazine.com<br> <br> "In post-World War II America, nine-year-old Nova Tierney worries about Russian bombs, but mostly she wants to find a suitable candidate to marry her mother and give her a new "pa." Catherine, a tormented soul, is terrified that the polio epidemic will touch her children. When it does strike Nova's 13-year-old brother, Dewey, Catherine weathers the blow via an unlikely friendship with a concentration camp survivor. Dewey's dream is to be the first man to land on the moon, and Nova promises to "watch the moon" for him until he gets better. In her third novel, Tatlock continues to weave 20th-century history into absorbing, finely crafted literary tales with issues of spirituality springing naturally from the text. For all collections and readers who enjoy realistic and hopeful family dramas."<br> -- Library Journal<br> <br> "Sometimes the greatest love is between two people whose hearts are someplace else," writes Tatlock. I'll Watch the Moon, set in 1948, is the beautiful and uplifting story of a family's relationship with a Polish holocaust survivor, Josef Karski. Told from a 9-year-old girl's point of view, this book builds slowly, lyrically, and inexorably to a heart-wrenching yet faith-affirming climax. I'll Watch the Moon evocatively communicates the characters' struggles with the problem of evil and the meaning of the Gospel, all the while transforming a story of single motherhood, abuse, and polio into a thoroughly satisfying read. This is novel with staying power.<br> -- Kim Pettit, CBA Marketplace<br> <br> Ann Tatlock has sure made me into an instant FAN with this wonderfully sweet, moving, TRUE story! I loved the historical fiction aspect of the story outlining the polio epidemic and the influenza outbreaks from our not-so-distant-past. I was also touched by the sweet, tender relationship between siblings with a less than perfect mother. This is a MUST read for those who have lost FAITH in mankind as well as the Almighty/Providence!! Get ready to stay up all night with this one! A wonderful gift for anyone on your holiday list!!<br> - D. Tinkham<br> <br> This was a very good book. This is a serious book about character and wondering about God in the hard times. I will be putting this book on the list of books I'd like my grown children to read/have. Along with "To Kill A Mockingbird". I got this one from the library, but I will be buying a copy now.<br> - SP<br> <br> I enjoyed this book so much! A warm story of family relationships and caring friends. I will recommend this book and this author to all my reading friends.<br> - Linda Murphree<br> <br> This book is a definite delight. So very captivating and just try to put it down. Excellent, Excellent, Excellent. Okay, I'm not a mental case. BUT this story will sound like I am. I started "I'll watch the Moon" and could not put it down. I read the entire book in 7 hours, I was completely engrossed with the family. Here's where I may seem crazy. When I went to bed that night, I included the characters on my prayer list. I had never done that before, but they became so real to me. Ann Tatlock is amazing.<br> - Cecil Stokes<br> <br> This is a wonderfully told story of life, death, despair and hope, in uncertain times of the post WWII era. The relationship between young Nova and her family and friends is realistic and endearing. I was struck by the closeness between her and her older, teenage brother. She idolizes him and he truly loves her. The most touching moments for me, however, are between Nova and Josef, each providing a source of comfort and encouragement to the other. The story of hatred, loss and forgiveness are entwined in a heartwarming lesson of God's love.<br> - TSW<br> <br> This is an incredible story of love and forgiveness. I will recommend this book to everyone I know! I can't remember the last time I read such a moving, touching story. - B. Anderson This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. From the first page, I couldn't put it down. It's excellently written and the characters are people I'll forever remember.<br> - C.

Rounding out the material on early attempts at illumination are variations on the open wick lamp designs executed in iron, tin, pewter, and brass, together with double iron "Betty" lamps, iron trammel candle holders, wrought iron candle stands, candle molds, reflectors, and other styles. Succeeding chapters range over candelabra lamps, ship lamps, whale oil lamps, wall sconces, bull's eye reading lamps, pierced tin lanterns, candle lanterns, bull's eye reading lanterns, hall lanterns, Sandwich glass candlesticks, lamps of unusual design, glass table and spark lamps, single and double burner mantle lamps, astral lamps, Luster lamps, Bennington ware, and chandeliers made of wood, iron, pewter, brass, bronze, silver, and crystal. Although the main emphasis is on the Colonial era, work up to the 1880's is considered. Each chapter contains information on Colonial life, customs, and habits, photographs of rare lamps and their locations, hints on collecting, and much other information not available elsewhere.<br>This volume, containing what is probably the largest selection of antique lamps ever illustrated together before, fills a long-felt need on the part of antique collectors, designers, historians, and Americana enthusiasts for a thorough-going survey of lighting in Colonial America.</p><p></p><h2>The Best of Sholom Aleichem</h2><p>Collects two dozen of the great Yiddish writer&#39;s cleverest, funniest, and most profound and touching stories, half of which are newly translated, and provides an introductory commentary on Aleichem&#39;s achievement</p><p>Text: English, Yiddish (translation)</p><h2>Papillon</h2><p>An immediate sensation upon its publication in 1969, Papillon is a vivid memoir of brutal penal colonies, daring prison breaks and heroic adventure on shark-infested seas. Condemned for a murder he did not commit, Henri Charriere, nicknamed Papillon, was sent to the penal colony of French Guiana. Forty-two days after his arrival he made his first break for freedom, travelling a thousand gruelling miles in an open boat. He was recaptured and put into solitary confinement but his spirit remained untamed: over thirteen years he made nine incredible escapes, including from the notorious penal colony on Devil&#39;s Island. This edition of Papillon, one of the greatest adventure stories ever told, includes an exclusive new essay by Howard Marks.</p><p><p>Henri Charri�re, called <em>Papillon,</em> for the butterfly tattoo on his chest, was convicted in Paris in 1931 for a murder he did not commit. When he was sentenced to life imprisonment in the penal colony of French Guiana, one thought obsessed him: escape. After planning and executing a series of treacherous yet failed attempts over many years, <em>Papillon</em> was eventually sent to the notorious prison, Devil's Island, a place from which no one had ever escaped -- that was, until <em>Papillon.</em> His escape, described in breathless detail, was one of the most incredible tests of human cunning, will, and endurance.</p><p>In 1968, more than twenty years after his final escape, Charri�re had his astonishing autobiography, <em>Papillon,</em> published in France to instant acclaim -- a worldwide bestseller describing the gripping, shocking odyssey of the author's imprisonment and escape over a greuling decade.</p>In 1931, 25-year-old Henri Charriere was found guilty of a murder he had not committed and transported to a penal colony in French Guiana. His numerous daring escapes and subsequent adventures are recounted in `Papillon&#39; (1969) and `Banco: The Further Adventures of Papillon&#39; (1973).

Adapted by Nadja Baer (Delivering Happiness: A Round Table Comic, Altucher Confidential: A Round Table Comic), illustrated by Nathan Lueth (Altucher Confidential, Everything's Okay), and overseen by former documentary filmmaker David Cohen, now VP of Round Table. Guidance provided by Dr. Katie Monnin, assistant professor of literacy at the University of North Florida.<br> <br>After releasing a variety of graphic works based on licensed bestselling business and motivational titles, Round Table Companies is turning to the educational market and releasing The Constitution. The full-color work includes the full text of the U.S. Constitution, brought to life by illustrations that examine its creation. <br> <br>Round Table Companies is best known for its line of Round Table Comics, comic adaptations of bestselling business titles like Chris Anderson's The Long Tail, or bestelling motivational titles like Robert Renteria's Mi Barrio (based on From the Barrio to the Board Room).

She speaks English, German, Italian, and Spanish (with varying degrees of fluency), can teach Taekwondo classes in Korean, and is currently working on expanding her French vocabulary. Since receiving a Bachelor's degree in Creative Writing with a minor in US History at the University of Minnesota, she has served as the office thesaurus, dictionary, translator, and spell-checker in every one of her day jobs. She wrote her first terrible novella at the age of eight, and is now focused on writing comics and novels for young adults. Her work can be seen for free in the online graphic novel, Impure Blood (www.impurebloodwebcomic.com), which is drawn by her soon-to-be husband, Nathan Lueth. Other illustrated projects she has scripted for Round Table include Everything's Okay (Sept 2011), Altucher Confidential (Dec 2011), Delivering Happiness (March 2012), and Influence: Science &amp; Practice (July 2012). Aside from a love of a good story with pretty pictures, Nadja and Nathan share a house, a cat, a turtle, and a belief that more people should embrace their inner nerdWhether you're a parent, a teacher, or an interested citizen, what if you could explain the Constitution and the disagreements that led to its crafting in about an hour? Round Table Companies, a publishing company, has done just that by assigning to a writer and an artist the challenge of creating a graphic adaptation to explain the writing of the United States Constitution and the effort the founding fathers exerted to ratify it. (Kate Kelly <i>Huffington Post, February 27, 2012</i>)<br><br>A breezy take on the past, but that&#x2019;s the point: to produce a comic that youngsters will actually be inclined to read, and perhaps even re-read. (<i>The A.V. Club, March 2012</i>)<br><br>I highly recommend The United States Constitution: A Round Table Comic Graphic Adaptation to anyone interested in United States history, or to teachers or families wanting to teach kids about our government in an entertaining way. I will be using it with my own kids whenever we study United States history or U.S. Government. (Jenny Williams <i>Geek Dad, March 14, 2012</i>)<br><br>While the U.S. Constitution&#x2019;s primary value is as a document, it is also a historical artifact that embodies the fascinating story of its own creation. In this version, Baer and Lueth (who coauthor the online graphic novel Impure Blood) generously cover both aspects, and the core text (the first ten amendments are noted but the text is not provided) is intercut with the drama of a Constitutional Congress that actually drafted an innovative work despite personal prejudices, turf wars, the divisive slavery issue, and the searing heat of a 1780s Philadelphia summer. In a triumph of character design, Lueth has created distinct, memorable images for each of the many delegates who hacked through their Gordian knots as the summer dragged on. Hill &amp; Wang&#x2019;s lengthier book of the same name includes all amendments and more background, but this volume dramatizes the compelling soap opera of egos that, against considerable odds, managed to create the imperfect yet sorely needed document that has endured for more than two centuries. VERDICT While context for some plot elements is not clear, this graphic novel dramatizes a historical precedent for group action despite disagreement that we should heed today.

Are these simple accidents as the bloody fool&#x201d; theory has it or are they inevitable?<br><br>The psychologist Norman F. Dixon argues that there is a pattern to inept generalship, and locates this pattern within the very act of creating armies in the first place, which in his view produces a levelling down of human capability that encourages the mediocre and limits the gifted. In this light, successful generals achieve what they do despite the stultifying features of the organization to which they belong. A classic study of military leadership, <i>On the Psychology of Military Incompetence</i> is at once an original exploration of the battles that have defined the last two centuries of human civilization and an essential guide for the next generation of military leaders.<br><br></p><p><b>Dr. Norman F.

Her aunt was Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and Queen Elizabeth is her first cousin. In the Second World War years, she &#39;lodged&#39; at Buckingham Palace while she worked for MI5.

However, Antoinette's task is somewhat muddled by Aidan's entreaty for her to find his friend's Glimpse and convince him to turn away from Paragor. There are some good imaginative elements here, but the Christian allegory is heavy-handed and unwieldy: science and logic are incompatible with faith and belief, and much emphasis is placed upon whether or not the people of Earth actively believe in the stories of Alleble (and therefore, ensure their salvation) without the compelling Gospel counterparts. The dialogue is much improved from the first book, but it still clunks along in parts where contemporary dialect is invoked.

Includes a few b&amp;w maps. Annotation (c) Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p><b>J. R. McNeill</b> is professor of history in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. His father, <b>William H. McNeill</b>, is emeritus professor of history at the University of Chicago.The spread of agriculture, the growth of world religions and the rise of European civilization to world dominance are some of the themes explored in this engrossing addition to the distinctive McNeill brand of broad-brush macro-history. The motor of history this time is the growing "web" of interactions-weaving together hunter-gatherer bands, then civilizations and finally the whole world-by which people, goods, diseases and ideas spread. As it binds ever more people ever more tightly, the web both brings them into conflict and lets them share and build on each other's achievements; thus Columbus's extension of the web to the Americas led to conquest but also to the exchange of New World potatoes and maize for Old World horses and smallpox. The father-son historian duo also revisit ideas from William's previous books, discussing the co-evolution of humans and microbes, the uneasy symbiosis between warrior elites and the farmers they protect and exploit, and the social solidarity imparted by group singing and dancing. More ecological than humanistic, the McNeill outlook sees conflict and cooperation as twin outcomes of the struggle for survival that drives developments in technology, political organization, social habits and even religious beliefs. This approach can be reductionist (Europe's vibrant civil society is said to spring from its use of mold-board plows); and as impersonal historical meta-agents go, the trendy "web" conceit is less substantive and fertile than other McNeill brainstorms. Still, this concise and beautifully written synthesis brims with revealing insights that make history comprehensible and enthralling. 25 illus., maps. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Coming Up for Air (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>George Orwell&#39;s paean to the end of an idyllic era in British history, Coming Up for Air is a poignant account of one man&#39;s attempt to recapture childhood innocence as war looms on the horizon. George Bowling, forty-five, mortgaged, married with children, is an insurance salesman with an expanding waistline, a new set of false teeth - and a desperate desire to escape his dreary life. He fears modern times - since, in 1939, the Second World War is imminent - foreseeing food queues, soldiers, secret police and tyranny. So he decides to escape to the world of his childhood, to the village he remembers as a rural haven of peace and tranquillity. But his return journey to Lower Binfield may bring only a more complete disillusionment ... &#39;Very funny, as well as invigoratingly realistic ... Nineteen Eighty-Four is here in embryo. So is Animal Farm ... not many novels carry the seeds of two classics as well as being richly readable themselves&#39; John Carey, Sunday Times</p><p>Insurance salesman George "Fatty" Bowling lives with his humorless wife and their two irritating children in a dull house in a tract development in the historyless London suburb of West Bletchley. The year is 1938; doomsayers are declaring that England will be at war again by 1941.<p> When George bets on an unlikely horse and wins, he finds himself with a little extra cash on his hands. What should he spend it on? "The alternatives, it seemed to me, were either a week-end with a woman or dribbling it quietly away on odds and ends such as cigars and double whiskeys." But a chance encounter with a poster in Charing Cross sets him off on a tremendous journey into his own memories--memories, especially, of a boyhood spent in Lower Binfield, the country village where he grew up. His recollections are pungent and detailed. Touch by touch, he paints for us a whole world that is already nearly lost: a world not yet ruled by the fear of war and not yet blighted by war's aftermath: </p><blockquote> 1913! My God! 1913! The stillness, the green water, the rushing of the weir! It'll never come again. I don't mean that 1913 will never come again. I mean the feeling inside you, the feeling of not being in a hurry and not being frightened, the feeling you've either had and don't need to be told about, or haven't had and won't ever have the chance to learn. </blockquote> Alas, George finds that even Lower Binfield has been darkened by the bomber's shadow. <p> Readers of <i>1984</i> will recognize Orwell's desperate insistence on the importance of the individual, of memory, of history, and of language; and they will find in Fatty Bowling one of Orwell's most engaging creations--a warm, witty, thinking, remembering Everyman in a world that is fast learning not to think and not to remember, and thus swiftly losing its mind. <i>--Daniel Hintzsche</i></p>8 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>My 5 Cambridge Friends: Burgess, Maclean, Philby, Blunt, and Cairncross by Their KGB Controller</h2><p>Recounts the work of the British spies</p><p>Yuri Modin was a Professor at the KGB Academy.Text: English <br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The dispossessed majority</h2><p>No one who reads this all-encompassing study of the American predicament will ever again view his country and himself in the same light.

They stand in the well from the navel down; and stationed round its bank they mount guard on the final pit of Hell.<br> <br>&#x2014;Dante Alighieri, Inferno, canto 31<br> <br>Moloch dreams.<br> <br>In the darkness of a Virginia prison cell, he stirs like an old demon goaded by memories of its lost humanity. The dream presses upon him once more, the First Dream, for in it lies his beginning, and his end.<br> <br>In the dream, he is standing on the verge of a dense forest and a smell clings to his clothing, the scent of animal fat and saltwater. There is a weight at his right hand, a musket, its rough leather strap hanging almost to the ground. On his belt there is a knife, and a powder horn, and a bag of shot. The crossing was difficult, for the sea was wild and the waves broke upon them with the force of a great hand. They lost a man on the journey to the island, drowned when one of the bark canoes capsized, and a pair of muskets and a leather bag filled with powder and shot descended with him beneath the waves. They cannot afford to lose weapons. They are hunted men, even as they are become hunters themselves this night. It is the year of our Lord 1693.<br> <br>Moloch, twisting on his bunk three centuries after the time of his dream, drifts between sleeping and wakefulness for an instant before he is drawn back into this world of images once again, slowly submerging, sinking deeper and deeper, like a man drowning in recollection, for the dream is not new, and its coming is by now expected when he lays his head upon the pillow and at last surrenders himself to its hold, his heartbeat loud in his ears, blood pumping.<br> <br>And blood flowing.<br> <br>He is aware, in the brief moment that he breaks the surface of his uneasy rest, that he has killed before, and will kill again. A conflation of reverie and reality occurs, for Moloch has slain in both dream and wakefulness, although now the distinction between the two realms has grown indistinct.<br> <br>This is a dream.<br> <br>This is not a dream.<br> <br>This is. This was.<br> <br>There is sand beneath his feet. Behind him, the canoes have been drawn up onto the shore and there are men around him, awaiting his command to move. They are twelve in total. He raises a hand to them and the whites follow him into the woods, the Indians breaking off and sprinting ahead of them. One of them glances back at him, and he sees that the native&#x2019;s face is pitted and scarred, one ear missing, a consequence of mutilation at the hands of his own people.<br> <br>Wabanaki. A Wabanaki mercenary, an outcast. The Indian wears his skins with the hair turned inward, in accordance with the demands of the winter season.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tanto,&#x201d; says the native, speaking the name of the god of ill will. The foul weather, the drowning, perhaps even the fact that he is here in this place, surrounded by hated white men, all are ascribable to the actions of the bad god. The Wabanaki is called Crow by the other men. They do not know his tribal name, although it is said that he was once a great man among his people, the son of a chief, a sagamore, and that he would have become chief himself had he not been exiled by them. Moloch does not reply, and the native follows his fellow scouts into the woods without another word.<br> <br>Later, when he awakes, Moloch will wonder once more at how he knows these things (for the dream has been coming more frequently in recent months, and in ever greater detail). He knows that he does not trust the Indians. There are three of them, the Wabanaki and two Mi&#x2019;kmaq with a price on their heads back at Fort Anne, vicious men who have pledged themselves to him in return for alcohol and weapons and the promise of rape. They are useful for now, but he feels uneasy around them. They are despised by their own people, and they are intelligent enough to realize that the men to whom they have attached themselves despise them too.<br> <br>In his dream, Moloch decides that they will have to be killed after their work here is done.<br> <br>From the trees ahead comes the sound of a brief scuffle, and moments later the Wabanaki mercenary emerges. There is a boy in his arms, no more than fifteen years of age. He is struggling against his captor&#x2019;s grasp, his cries stifled by the native&#x2019;s large hand. His feet kick impotently at the air. One of the Mi&#x2019;kmaq follows, holding the boy&#x2019;s musket. He has been apprehended before he can fire off a warning shot.<br> <br>Moloch approaches, and the boy stops kicking as he recognizes the face before him. He shakes his head, and tries to utter words. The native releases his hand from the boy&#x2019;s mouth but keeps a knife pressed to his throat so that he does not cry out. His tongue freed, the boy finds that he has nothing to say, for there is nothing that can be said. No words can prevent what is about to occur. Instead, his breath plumes whitely in the cold night air, as if his essence were already departing his body, his soul fleeing the pain of what his physical being is about to endure.<br> <br>Moloch reaches out and grips the boy&#x2019;s face in his hands.<br> <br>&#x201c;Robert Littlejohn,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Did they tell you to keep watch for me?&#x201d;<br> <br>Robert Littlejohn does not respond. Moloch can feel him trembling beneath his hand. He is surprised that they have maintained even this level of vigilance for so long. After all, it has been many months since his enforced departure.<br> <br>It strikes Moloch that they must fear him a great deal.<br> <br>&#x201c;Still, they must think themselves safe if they leave only a child to watch the western approaches to Sanctuary.&#x201d; He eases his grip on the boy&#x2019;s skin, and caresses it gently with his fingertips.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are a brave boy, Robert.&#x201d;<br> <br>He stands and nods at the Indian, and the Wabanaki draws the knife across the boy&#x2019;s throat, gripping him by the hair to pull his head back so that the blade will have easier passage. Moloch steps back to avoid the arterial spray, but continues to stare into the boy&#x2019;s eyes as the life leaves them. In his dream, Moloch is disappointed by the nature of the boy&#x2019;s passing. There is no fear in his eyes, although the boy must surely have been terrified during his last seconds on this earth. Instead, Moloch sees only a promise, unspoken and yet to be fulfilled.<br> <br>When the boy is dead, the Wabanaki carries him to the rocks above the beach and casts him into the sea. His body sinks from view.<br> <br>&#x201c;We move on,&#x201d; says Moloch. They ascend to the forest, their footfalls carefully placed, avoiding fallen branches that might snap loudly and alert the dogs. It is bitterly cold, and snow begins to fall, driven into their faces by the harsh wind, but Moloch knows this place, even without the scouts to guide him.<br> <br>Ahead of them, a Mi&#x2019;kmaq raises his hand and the party halts. Of the other natives, there is no sign. Silently, Moloch creeps up to the guide&#x2019;s side. He points straight ahead. Moloch can see nothing for a time, until the tobacco glows briefly red as the sentry takes a long draw. A shadow grows behind him, and the man&#x2019;s body arcs against the hilt of the knife. The pipe falls to the ground, shedding red ash on the dirt and dying with a hiss upon the newly fallen snow.<br> <br>Suddenly the barking begins and one of the settlers&#x2019; beasts, more wolf than hound, breaks through a patch of scrub and bears down upon a figure to Moloch&#x2019;s left. It leaps, and then there is a gunshot and the dog bucks and twists in midair, dying with a yelp and falling on a patch of stony ground. Now the men are emerging from the cover of the woods and there are voices calling and women shouting and children crying. Moloch raises his musket at a settler who appears as a silhouette in the doorway of one of the cabins, the dying embers of the fire within making him an easy target. It is Alden Stanley, a fisherman like the savior he so adores. Moloch pulls the trigger and Alden Stanley is briefly lost in a cloud of sparks and smoke. When it clears, Moloch glimpses Stanley&#x2019;s feet twitching in the open doorway until finally they grow still. He sees more knives appear, and short-handled axes are drawn as his men move in for close-quarters combat, but there is little fight in these people. They have been caught unawares, convinced of their safety in this remote place, content with only a single sleepy guard and a boy on a rock, and the men are upon them before they even have a chance to load their weapons. The settlers outnumber their attackers by three to one, but that will make no difference to the outcome. Already, they are beaten. Soon, his men will pick their victims from among the surviving women and young girls, before they too are dispatched. Moloch sees one man, Barone, already in pursuit of a little girl of five or six, with pretty blond hair. She is wearing a loose ivory gown; its folds hang like wings from her raised arms. Moloch knows her name. As he watches, Barone catches her by the hair and pulls her to him.<br> <br>Even in his dream, Moloch feels no urge to intervene.<br> <br>A woman is running, making for the interior, and he moves off in pursuit of her. She is easy to track, her progress noisy, until the stones and roots begin to take their toll on her bare feet, tearing at her soles and heels and slowing her down. He moves ahead of her and cuts into her path, so that she is still looking back toward the slaughter when he emerges from his cover, the pale light filtering through the branches casting his shadow across her features.<br> <br>And when she sees him, her fear increases, but he recognizes the anger there too, and the hatred.<br> <br>&#x201c;You,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;You brought them here.&#x201d;<br> <br>His right hand lashes out, catching her across the face and sending her sprawling on the ground. There is blood on her mouth as she tries to rise. Then he is on top of her, pushing her nightdress up over her thighs and belly. She strikes at him with her fists, but he throws aside his gun and holds her arms over her head with his left hand. His right hand fumbles at his belt, and she hears the sound of steel upon leather as the knife is unsheathed.<br> <br>&#x201c;I told you I&#x2019;d return,&#x201d; he whispers. &#x201c;I told you I&#x2019;d be back.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then he leans in closer to her, his mouth almost touching her lips.<br> <br>&#x201c;Know me, wife.&#x201d;<br> <br>In the moonlight the blade flashes, and in his dream Moloch begins his work.<br> <br>&#x2217;&nbsp;&#x2217;&nbsp;&#x2217;<br> <br>So Moloch sleeps, believing that he dreams; and far to the north, on the island of his visions, Sylvie Lauter opens her eyes.<br> <br>It is January, centuries after the events of which Moloch dreams, and the world is skewed. It rests at an angle, as if the physical reality has somehow come to resemble her own perception of it. It has always appeared canted to her, in a way, always off-kilter. She has never quite fit into it. At school, she has found a place with the other outcasts, the ones with the dyed hair and downcast eyes. They give her some sense of belonging, even as they reject the concept of belonging as somehow unsound. None of them belongs. The world will not have them.<br> <br>But now that world is altered. Trees grow diagonally, and a doorway has opened to reveal the night sky. She reaches out to touch it, but her view is obscured by a spider&#x2019;s web. She tries to focus and sees the starburst shatter in the glass. She blinks.<br> <br>There is blood on her fingers, and blood on her face.<br> <br>And then the pain comes. There is a great pressure on her legs, and a terrible ache in her chest. To breathe is to be constricted by nails. She attempts to swallow and tastes copper on her tongue. With her right hand she wipes the blood from her eyes and clears her vision.<br> <br>The hood of the car is crumpled inward, wrapped around the trunk of the oak tree in a twisted embrace. Her legs are lost amid the wreckage of the dashboard and the workings of the engine. She remembers the moment when the car veered out of control on the slope. The night rewinds for her. The crash itself is a jumble of sights and noises. She recalls feeling strangely calm as the car struck a great shard of sloping concrete, the front lifting as the passenger side of the vehicle left the ground. She remembers branches and green leaves filling the windshield; the dull sound of the impact; a grunt from Wayne that reminded her of the sound he makes when he is puzzled, which is often, or when he climaxes, which is often too. Now rewind again, and she and Wayne are on the edge of the man-made slope, the former site of the old gun emplacements and army bunkers, ready to freewheel down the incline. Now she is breaking into the garage, and watching Wayne steal the car. Now she is on her back upon a mattress, and Wayne is making love to her. He makes love badly, but still he is her Wayne.<br> <br>Wayne.<br> <br>She turns to her left and calls his name, but no sound comes. She again forms the word with her lips, and manages a whisper.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wayne.&#x201d;<br> <br>Wayne is dead. His eyes are half closed, staring lazily at her. There is blood around his mouth, and the steering column is lost in his chest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wayne.&#x201d;<br> <br>She begins to cry.<br> <br>When she opens her eyes, there are lights before her. Help, she thinks. Help is coming. The lights hover around the windshield and the damaged hood. The interior of the car glows with a diffused illumination as one of them passes overhead, and she wonders at how they can move in that way.<br> <br>&#x201c;Help me,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>A single light draws closer, nearing the open window to her right, and she can at last see the form behind it. The shape is hunched, and cloaked with leaves and wood and mud and darkness. It smells of damp earth. It lifts its head to her, and in the strange half-light that filters from the lamp in its hand, Sylvie registers gray skin, and dark eyes like oil bubbles, and torn, bloodless lips, and knows that she is soon to join Wayne, that they will travel together into the world beyond this one, and that at last she will find a place where she fits into the great pattern that has remained hidden from her for so long. She is not yet frightened. She simply wants the pain to end.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; she says to the dead woman at the windshield, but the woman retreats and Sylvie has a sense that she is afraid, that there is something here that even the dead fear. The other lights also begin to recede and Sylvie extends an imploring hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t leave me alone.&#x201d;<br> <br>But she is not alone.<br> <br>A hissing sound comes from close by, and a figure floats beside her at the other side of the glass. It is smaller than the woman, and it holds no light in its hands. Its hair is white in the moonlight, and is so long and bedraggled that it almost entirely covers its face. It moves nearer as Sylvie feels a wave of tiredness wash over her. She hears herself moan. Her mouth opens as she tries to speak, and she no longer has the strength to close it again.<br> <br>The figure at the window presses itself against the car. Its hands, with their small, gray fingers, clutch the top of the glass, trying to force it farther down. Sylvie&#x2019;s vision is dimmed once more, obscured by blood and tears, but she can see that it is a little girl who is trying to enter the car, to join her in her agony.<br> <br>&#x201c;Honey,&#x201d; Sylvie whispers.<br> <br>Sylvie tries to move and the pain surges through her with the force of a jolt of electricity. It hurts her to turn her head to the right, so she can see the girl only from the corner of her eye. Momentarily, Sylvie&#x2019;s mind clears. If she can feel pain, then she is still alive. If she is alive, then there is hope. All else is just the imaginings of a mind driven to the edge by trauma and distress.<br> <br>The woman with the light was not dead.<br> <br>The child is no...</p><h2>Secret Records Revealed: The Men, the Money, and the Methods Behind the New World Order</h2><p>In 1890 Cecil Rhodes stated he would start a movement that would in 100 years bring in a world government in which there would be no war and only one language.

While the quest for Everest may have begun as a grand and imperial gesture, it ended as a mission of revival for a country and a lost generation bled white by war. Davis&#39;s intrepid history of Mallory asks not whether he was</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011</strong>: It&#x2019;s tempting to call Wade Davis&#x2019;s magnificent <em>Into the Silence</em> an Everest of a book. But that would be misleading. It is more like K2: challenging, technically complex, and hugely rewarding upon completion. The book starts off not with mountaineering, but with vivid, novelistic descriptions of the horrors of the First World War. Years of waste and destruction in the trenches, Davis argues, &#x201c;led a desperate nation to embrace the assault on Everest as a gesture of imperial redemption.&#x201d; Those who endured attempts on the summit all bore the scars of the Great War&#x2014;and they were drawn to the mountain by an almost contradictory desire for conquest and spiritual ablution. At the center of it all is Mallory, whose eventual disappearance effectively closed that chapter in mountaineering. His utterance &#x201c;because it&#x2019;s there&#x201d; became a new war cry, but he climbed for deeper reasons entirely. <em>-- Chris Schluep</em>WADE DAVIS is the bestselling author of several books, including <i>The Serpent and the Rainbow</i> and <i>One River</i>, and is an award-winning anthropologist, ethnobotanist, filmmaker and photographer.

Seared by the nearcollapse and then "Aryanization" of his family's long-established bank in the 1930s and then frustrated by the stagnation of its Wall Street sister, Kuhn Loeb, in the 1950s, Warburg resolved that his own firm of S. G. Warburg (founded in 1946) would be different. <br><br> An obsessive perfectionist with an aversion to excessive risk, Warburg came to embody the ideals of the <i>haute banquet</i>-high finance- always eschewing the fast buck in favor of gilt-edged advice. He was not only the master of the modern merger and founder of the eurobond; he was also a key behind-the-scenes adviser to governments in London, Tokyo, and Jerusalem-to his critics, a "financial Rasputin." Like a character from a Thomas Mann novel, Warburg was a complex and ambivalent man, as much a psychologist, politician, and actor-manager as he was a banker. In <i>High Financier</i> Niall Ferguson shares the first book-length examination of a man whose life and work suggest an alternative to the troubled business principles that helped shape our current financial landscape.</p><p>Bestselling author Niall Ferguson reveals for the first time the true extent of Siegmund Warburg&#39;s influence---and the lessons we can learn in a time of crisis from the last of the high financiers.Niall Ferguson is Laurence A.

As if rising from an uneasy grave, Palchinsky's ghost leads us through the miasma of Soviet technology and industry, pointing out the mistakes he condemned in his time, the corruption and collapse he predicted, the ultimate price paid for silencing those who were not afraid to speak out. The story of this visionary engineer's life and work, as Loren Graham relates it, is also the story of the Soviet Union's industrial promise and failure.<br>We meet Palchinsky in pre-Revolutionary Russia, immersed in protests against the miserable lot of laborers in the tsarist state, protests destined to echo ironically during the Soviet worker's paradise. Exiled from the country, pardoned and welcomed back at the outbreak of World War I, the engineer joined the ranks of the Revolutionary government, only to find it no more open to criticism than the previous regime. His turbulent career offers us a window on debates over industrialization. Graham highlights the harsh irrationalities built into the Soviet system - the world's most inefficient steel mill in Magnito-gorsk, the gigantic and ill-conceived hydro-electric plant on the Dnieper River, the infamously cruel and mislocated construction of the White Sea Canal. Time and again, we see the effect of policies that ignore not only workers' and consumers' needs but also sound management and engineering precepts. And we see Palchinsky's criticism and advice, persistently given, consistently ignored, continue to haunt the Soviet Union right up to its dissolution in 1991.<br>The story of a man whose gifts and character set him in the path of history, The Ghost of the Executed Engineer is also a cautionary tale about the fate of engineering that disregards social and human issues.</p><p>Stalin ordered his execution, but here Peter Palchinsky has the last word.

Designed for history aficionados, trivia buffs, or anyone with a curious mind, Timelines of World History takes an innovative approach to the traditional, text-driven style of a date-by-date chronology. Tracing the progress of humanity from the dawn of history to the present day, the book follows major historical events, cultural milestones, the expansions of empires, and the inventions and achievements of civilizations. Important events are cross-referenced with specific dates, important historical figures are profiled, and introductory essays profile what was happening and why. With more than 500 photographs and illustrations and over 25 maps, this is the most authoritative visual chronological record of the last 20,000 years.</p><p>Intended for quick reference or for trivia buffs rather than for any kind of genuine historical research, this volume uses time lines to provide "a visual chronicle of human history and development" from 10,000 B.C.E. to the present. Time lines appear in four columns--one each for Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas and Australasia--and are accompanied by gorgeous illustrations and maps. The outer column of each page has sidebars containing summaries of key events, condensed biographies, or descriptions of places. There is no index but rather a concordance, which occupies more than 200 pages at the back of the book, containing its own individual country chronologies, more brief biographies, and cross-references.<p>As might be expected from a work of this nature, its breadth is so wide that it renders the depth of coverage extremely shallow. In terms of volume of information, there is not much more conveyed here per subject than there would be in a good dictionary. For example, there are a total of about five brief paragraphs on World War I and about seven on World War II. Because world events are segregated by continent and presented in parallel fashion on the page, <i>Timelines</i> seems most valuable for comparing contemporaneous significant events at a glance. This also means that numerous pages contain blank columns for Africa and the Americas because of the relative lack of historical information about those parts of the world. The book's greatest strength is its graphics--13 full-color, foldout maps; more than a dozen smaller color maps; and more than 500 attractive illustrations and trenchant photographs.</p><p>This is a kind of deluxe version of the popular <i>The Timetables of History: A Horizontal Linkage of People and Events</i> (3d ed., Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991), though that work is subdivided by subject (history, literature, religion, science, etc.) rather than by continent. This new title can only be the starting point of any meaningful inquiry, but the colorful graphics may grab the attention of younger readers and casual browsers. Recommended for public libraries. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i></p>Depth is ruthlessly sacrificed to breadth in this atlas of world history. The material is arranged in separate timelines-for Asia, Africa, Europe and "Americas and Australasia"-running vertically down facing pages, with supplementary maps and short sidebar essays. The format is meant to give these regions equal representation and facilitate comparative history by correlating at a glance contemporaneous events across the globe. Unfortunately, while some developments-such as the early spread of agriculture, technology and cities-are occasionally illuminated by this approach, it is almost always historically incoherent. The division of timelines by continent is particularly thoughtless. Events in the Roman Empire are confusingly split up between Asian, African and European timelines, while the Asia timeline jumbles together the journeys of St. Paul with news from Han China. The "Americas and Australasia" timeline stays blank for pages on end as empires rise and fall elsewhere, taking up space better used to flesh out other too-terse entries; its spurious continuity implies that the United States is more an outgrowth of Olmec history than European history. While possibly of value for quick reference, the graphical juxtaposition of factoids presented here is no substitute for skillful narrative synthesis.

The one problem was the title: couldn&#x2019;t some prophetic fact-checker have seen that the worst years of our lives&#x2014;far worse&#x2014;were still to come? Here they are, the 2000s, and in <i>This Land Is Their Land</i>, Ehrenreich subjects them to the most biting and incisive satire of her career.</p><p>Taking the measure of what we are left with after the cruelest decade in memory, Ehrenreich finds lurid extremes all around. While members of the moneyed elite can buy congressmen, many in the working class can barely buy lunch. While a wealthy minority obsessively consumes cosmetic surgery, the poor often go without health care for their children. And while the corporate C-suites are now nests of criminality, the less fortunate are fed a diet of morality, marriage, and abstinence. Ehrenreich&#x2019;s antidotes are as sardonic as they are spot-on: pet insurance for your kids; Salvation Army fashions for those who can no longer afford Wal-Mart; and boundless rage against those who have given us a nation scarred by deepening inequality, corroded by distrust, and shamed by its official cruelty.</p><p>Full of wit and generosity, these reports from a divided nation show once again that Ehrenreich is, as Molly Ivins said, &#x201c;good for the soul.&#x201d;</p>&#x2014;*<i>The Times</i> (London)</p><p><p>Barbara Ehrenreich is the author of fourteen books, including <i>Dancing in the Streets</i> and <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Nickel and Dimed</i> and <i>Bait and Switch</i>.

We hadn&#x2019;t had an enemy scary enough to pull us together since the USSR deconstructed in 1991, and now here was one capable of bringing down the World Trade Center with box cutters, a group that had declared they wanted every one of us dead, from the janitors in our buildings to the CEOs. Transfixed by the jihadists, we wrapped ourselves in flags&#x2014;flag sweaters, T-shirts, decals, lapel pins, even underwear and bathing suits. "United We Stand," proclaimed the bumper stickers, and "These Colors Don&#x2019;t Run."<p></p>To be sure, this unity was as thin as a starlet after a sojourn at a spa. How were we to express it, for example, other than through our sartorial decisions? We pondered the ubiquitous instruction to "report all and activities" and that even more enigmatic command from the New York mass transit system: "See something, say something." The president advised us to carry on shopping, which we did to the best of our abilities, remaining in a state of dazed puzzlement while the TSA stripped off our shoes and our belts and the government ripped away habeas corpus and all the elementary ingredients of privacy.<p></p>But whatever resonated with us about the idea of a "homeland" and "one nation, indivisible" was being quietly undercut by a force more powerful than terrorism, more divisive than treason. In a process that had begun in the 1980s and suddenly accelerated in the early 2000s, the ground was shifting under our feet, recarving the American landscape. The peaks of great wealth grew higher, rising up beyond the clouds, while the valleys of poverty sank lower into perpetual shadow. The once broad plateau of the middle class eroded away into a narrow ledge, with the white-knuckled occupants holding on for dear life.<p></p>It wasn&#x2019;t just a "shift," of course, governed by impersonal geological forces. The rude hand of human intervention could be felt in 2001, when the government gave the airlines a $20 billion post-9/11 bail-out, with nothing for the ninety thousand freshly laid-off airline employees. In another deft upward redistribution of wealth, the administration cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans while cutting back on services and programs, such as financial aid, for everyone else. We had never had a gang in Washington as noisily committed to "Christian values," and yet they had managed to stand core biblical teachings on their head.<p></p>The results were glaringly visible by 2004, when the Democratic vice presidential candidate announced there were now "two Americas." This was almost certainly an undercount. We had divided into two markets&#x2014;upscale and downscale, Sears and Saks&#x2014;two decades earlier, and now these were further subdividing. The middle class, battered by wave after wave of outsourcings and layoffs, scrambled to meet the ever-rising costs of health care, fuel, and college education. The traditional working class, already savaged by deindustrialization, took the low-paying service jobs that were left, trading their hard hats for mops and trays. They crowded grown children and grandchildren into their homes, which they refinanced at usurious rates. They faced speedups at work and cutbacks in pay. When their monthly health insurance premiums exceeded the mortgage or rent, they abandoned the insurance and fell back on Advil.<p></p>As for the rich, mere millionaires and the old-money sorts who favor weather-beaten summer homes in Nantucket barely qualified anymore. The upper class split into the merely affluent, who shop at Williams-Sonoma, and the �berrich, who had others do their shopping for them, as well as their child raising, bill paying, servant supervising, and party throwing. At the pinnacles of the wealth scale, extravagance reigned on a scale not seen since the late Roman Empire. Freshly fattened CEOs, hedge fund operators, and financiers hired interior decorators for their private jets, slugged back $10,000 martinis at the Algonquin Hotel in Manhattan, and, in one case, staged a $2 million birthday party in Sardinia featuring an ice statue of David urinating vodka.<p></p>There was a connection, as most people suspected, between the massive buildup of wealth among the few and the anxiety and desperation of the many. The money that fueled the explosion of gluttony at the top had to come from somewhere or, more specifically, from someone. Since no domestic oil deposits had been discovered, no new seams of uranium or gold, and since the war in Iraq enriched only the military contractors and suppliers, it had to have come from other Americans. In fact, the greatest capitalist innovations of this past decade have been in the realm of squeezing money out of those who have little to spare: taking away workers&#x2019; pensions and benefits to swell profits, offering easy credit on dubious terms, raising insurance premiums and refusing to insure those who might ever make a claim, downsizing workforces to boost share prices, even falsifying time records to avoid paying overtime.<p></p>Prosperity, in America, had not always been a zero-sum game. Early twentieth-century capitalists&#x2014;who were certainly no saints&#x2014;envisioned a prosperous people generating profits for the upper class by buying houses and cars and washing machines. But somewhere along the line, the ethos changed from we&#x2019;re all in this together to get what you can while the getting is good. Let the environment decay, the infrastructure crumble, the public hospitals close, the schools get by on bake sales, the workers drop from exhaustion&#x2014;who cares? Raise the premiums, reduce the wages, add new mystery fees to each bill, and let the devil take the hindmost. Only when the poor suckers at the bottom stopped buying and defaulted on their mortgages did anyone notice them.<p></p>And where were the rest of us during this orgy of accumulation at the top? What were we thinking as the "invisible hand" of the market reached into our pockets for our wallets? The truth is that most of us were too focused on the tasks at hand to pay much attention to what was going on with the neighbors. We were paying the bills, holding on to the job, occasionally making contact with the children. And when we did take a moment to tune into the public discourse, we heard very little that addressed our frustration and pain.<p></p>The war with Iraq, for starters, which had to be one of the greatest non sequiturs in military history. Attacked by a gang composed largely of Islamic militants from Saudi Arabia, the United States countered by invading an unrelated country, and one of the most secular in the Middle East at that. Briefly fascinated by the toppling of statues and flattening of towns, we rallied to "support our troops," although no one could figure out what we were supporting them to do. If the war had been launched as a distraction from the corporate scandals of 2002, as one theory goes, it soon became something we needed distraction from. Five years later, and after the hideous revelations of Abu Ghraib, we&#x2019;ve spent $505 billion, lost four thousand American lives, and achieved the status of a pariah among nations.<p></p>Issues more appropriate to a middle school biology or sex ed class also loomed large. Stem cells, for example: whole political careers were based on the defense of these wee entities and their slightly larger cousins the embryos. Insentient forms of life, such as a woman in a vegetative state, excited loud indignation, while the intact and living received barely a nod. In 2005, top Republicans rushed to the bedside of Terri Schiavo, bypassing the thousands of other ailing Floridians hit by Medicaid cuts. Gay marriage was another unlikely issue seemingly designed to distract us from the ongoing economic looting. How one person&#x2019;s marriage could threaten another&#x2019;s is a mystery to me, but whole elections were tipped in favor of the party of wealth, for no other purpose than to spare the public from the spectacle of same-sex embraces at the altar. As for the unmarried of any sexual orientation, abstinence was strongly recommended, along with prayer and cold showers.<p></p>Illegal immigrants are our latest distraction, vilified as if they had come to run drugs and collect welfare rather than mow lawns, clean offices, pack meat, and process poultry. There is no welfare anymore, of course, and that may be what makes the immigrants such an appealing target. Twenty years ago, right-wing demagogues had welfare recipients to kick around as a stand-in for the hated poor; today, immigrant workers have been pressed into playing the scapegoat role. The strategy is the same: to peel off some segment of the poorer classes, label them as enemies, and try to whip up rage that might have been directed at the economic over class. There may be reasonable arguments for limiting immigration, but it wasn&#x2019;t a Mexican who took away your pension or sold you on a dodgy mortgage.<p></p>Maybe, too, our critical faculties were dimmed by the habit, endemic in the early 2000s, of magical thinking. The biggest self-help best seller of the last year tells you how you can have anything you want, simply by willing it, and the fiction side of the bookstore is ruled by a young magician in training. Girls are forsaking feminism for a princess fantasy that culminates in weddings lavish enough to bankrupt a couple before they can even take out a car loan. Karl Rove derided the press for its membership in the "reality-based community," and the fastest-growing brand of religion is of the magical "name it and claim it" variety, in which the deity exists only to meet one&#x2019;s immediate, self-identified needs. It would be shortsighted to whine about rising debts and falling incomes when, with a little spiritual effort, the miraculous could happen to you.<p></p>How many "wake-up calls" do we need, people&#x2014;how many broken levees, drowned cities, depleted food pantries, people dead for lack of ordinary health care? We approach the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century in a bleak landscape cluttered with boarded-up homes and littered with broken dreams. The presidential candidates talk about "change," but don&#x2019;t bother to articulate what kind of change. Why don&#x2019;t we dare say it? The looting of America has gone on too long, and the average American is too maxed out, overworked, and overspent to have anything left to take. We&#x2019;ll need a new deal, a new distribution of power and wealth, if we want to restore the beautiful idea that was "America."<p></p>We could let the nation continue to fall apart, of course&#x2014; dividing ever more clearly into the gated communities on the one hand and trailer parks and tenements on the other&#x2014; until we eventually become one of those areas of the world prefixed by the mournful word former.<p></p>But I like to think we could find in our hearts some true ground for unity, some awareness of a common condition and collective aspiration. Maybe we could find it in an effort to restore America&#x2019;s lost glory&#x2014;the beauty of our land before all the fences and sprawl, the respect we once enjoyed from people around the world. Or maybe we need to find it in the common threats we face, not only from the human enemies that our foreign policy has been breeding so prolifically but from the global challenge of climate change and shrinking supplies of water and oil. And maybe, someday, we would even regain the confidence to extend that sense of unity and connectedness to all of our fellow human beings, wherever they may reside on the planet.<p></p>Excepted from This Land Is Their Land by Barbara Enrenreich<p></p>Copyright @ 2008 by Barbara Enrenreich<p></p>Published in 2008 by Henry Holt and Company, LLC<p></p>All rights reserved.

After deciding on the right materials, try your hand at courtyards, quadrangles, and cloisters; formal architecture: domestic and seaside buildings; and street life..Make wood look weather-beaten produce the cool appearance of stone, and add reflections to windows. Throughout, 120 paintings in various stages of completion guide you, showing the effects of color, shadowing and balance. A Selection of F &amp; W's North Light Book Club.</p><p>The new HarperCollins "Learn To Draw" series contains more than a dozen slim, inexpensive volumes, each devoted to a single genre. Cook's book on buildings is a good introduction to basic drawing tools and materials, with brief demonstrations and tips. The volume suffers from the smallness of many of the illustrations and the resulting loss of detail. An earlier effort by Michael Woods, The Complete Drawing Course: How You Can Master All the Techniques of Drawing in Just 25 Minutes (Batsford, 1995) is broader in scope and a better value. For those who want to render buildings in watercolor, Taylor's book is an unequivocal success. A member of the Society of Architectural Illustrators, Taylor has created a sumptuous work, rich in detailed images, and, moreover, complete with a brilliant text. For readers who wonder how a particular shadow is splashed over a stucco wall or how to get small panes in sunlight to look like real glass, Taylor reveals the color values and techniques necessary. Highly recommended, for beginning or advanced artists. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>To the Last Man: Spring 1918</h2><p>As poignant as Niall Fregusson&#39;s The Pity of War, as powerful as John Keegan&#39;s The First World War, this is an engrossing eye-witness history of World War I. From the trenches to the battle lines, in bold advances and fighting retreats and courageous stands, this oral chronicle of World War I by award-winning historian Lyn Macdonald brings to life the massive German offensive of Spring 1918 that became the Second Battle of Somme. As moving as it is monumental, the volume recounts the devastating assault in the words of the men who survived it -- from the commanders to the war-weary British Tommies, the eager German foot soldiers, and the as-yet-untested doughboys fresh from the U.S. Unforgettably, To the Last Man puts a human face on the armies in the field as it gives voice to the soldiers who together held their position against the foe-resisting, as the Allied command had ordered, &#34;to the last round and the last man.&#34;</p><p>Beautifully written, spectacularly researched account of the almost end of the Great War by the author of 1915: The Death of Innocence (1995). Macdonald, who has written six other books on aspects of WWI, weaves together the forgotten voices of the war to create a comprehensive picture that offers a perspective unlike the ones provided by such contemporary historians as John Keegan or Niall Ferguson, both of whom focus on the larger activities and implications of the war. Macdonald uses the official history only as background to the accounts of the enlisted men, and often their stories run counter to the official record. To the Last Man concentrates on the massive German offensive of March 1918, an attempt to turn the tide of the war. Freed up from hostilities on the Eastern Front by a Russia that was wracked by revolution and threatened in France by a soon-to-arrive American army, the Germans launched what was to be their last effort to break the stalemate in their favor with a massive attack on France. Throughout the narrative the oral testimonies of the officers and soldiers punctuate MacDonald's clear recounting of the history and present haunting memories of the war to end all warstales such as the memory of a British brigadier general walking through a portion of the battlefield where his son died and questioning ``how it was possible that any troops could attack such a position in broad daylight on a lovely July morning.'' The ultimate account of the end of the Great War and a poignant reminder that the best military history doesn't forget the soldiers who fought and those who died. (16 pages photos, not seen; 17 maps) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This has been a good year for books on the First World War. Macdonald's oral history of the last German offensive of the war is a great complement to John Keegan's comprehensive The First World War and Niall Ferguson's revisionist The Pity of War. Macdonald (They Called It Passchendaele, etc.) has spent many years interviewing British and Canadian veterans of WWI. Her large archive alone is an important achievement, but from this raw material she has gone on to cobble a number of remarkable books. This, the latest, focuses on one of the most deadly and strategically important confrontations of the war: the Second Battle of the Somme, in which the Allied command ordered the field commanders to resist the German attack "to the last round and the last man." Macdonald is particularly skilled at presenting war from the standpoint of those directly involved in its bloody business. At the same time, she never fails to set events in their proper historical, political and military context. Unlike her previous books, this volume includes a significant amount of first-person testimony from German soldiers culled from an impressive private collection of accounts gathered by American publisher Richard Baumgartner in 1981. As Macdonald points out, "the stories of some of those German boys are mirror images of those of their British counterpartsAsome of whom, indeed, must have been literally within yards of them." Macdonald's uncompromising narrative brings the bloody dawn of the century into vivid, humane relief. 60 b&amp;w photos; 17 maps.

It has infiltrated the American mainstream, with its stars showing up as mainstream TV hosts, making guest appearances in Hollywood feature films, and gracing the CD covers&#x2013;and arms&#x2013;of rock stars and Hollywood actors alike. But what most people don't know is how the porn industry got started&#x2013;with a $22,000 Mafia investment in a film called <em>Deep Throat</em>&#x2013;or how it mushroomed over the next quarter&#x2013;century despite efforts by politicians, the FBI, and others to bring it down.</p><p> <em>The Other Hollywood</em> tells that story, through hundreds of interviews by the people who lived through it. In the riveting oral&#x2013;history format that made his first book, <em>Please Kill Me</em>, one of the most memorable accounts of 1970s underground culture, Legs McNeil now pulls back the grimy satin sheets on one of the most astounding success stories in the history of American business. Careening back and forth between two groups&#x2013;the actresses, directors, and others who made the films and the shady underworld figures who financed them&#x2013;The Other Hollywood offers scores of never&#x2013;before&#x2013;told stories, all in the voices of those who lived them.</p><p> Witty, always compelling, and ultimately moving,<em> The Other Hollywood</em> is a Hollywood Babylon for today.</p></p><p>From the nudie cuties of the 1950s to celebrity porn in the late 1990s, <i>The Other Hollywood: The Uncensored Oral History of the Porn Film Industry</i> offers an insider's view of the adult film industry's transition from a shady, backroom business to a $10-billion-per-year money machine and mainstream acceptance. The story is told through interviews with hundreds of actors, directors, law enforcement officials, and other participants, all edited together with expert skill and pacing. <p> The industry exploded in the early 1970s with the success of the Mafia-backed <i>Deep Throat</i>, which reportedly grossed $100 million after an initial $22,000 investment. Featured at the Cannes Film Festival in 1973, the film ushered in the rise of "porno chic," making it fashionable, for a time, to take a date to a porn film.

Filled with sleazy intrigue, vivid details, and many heartbreaking--and even touching--stories, <i>The Other Hollywood</i> covers the actors, the numerous legal challenges to the industry, FBI sting operations, the Mafia connection, rampant drug use, rock stars, celebrities, the opposition by religious and political groups, the emergence of AIDS (that claimed the lives of porn superstars such as the famously endowed John Holmes), and the explosion of the video market and its overnight fortunes.

From decorative elements of buildings to calligraphy and the embellishment of everyday objects, ornamentation, that most characteristic Islamic art form, is displayed in an extraordinary rich range of ways.

Colonsay is a stark region of stone and seals and sheep and storms, with its residents still living under a feudal system of farmers, crofter, and lord.

Her answers are found in <i>Naomi's Breakthrough Guide</i>, a description of 20 choices that helped her overturn the "death sentence" of a diagnosis of hepatitis C. In a buoyant supportive voice, Judd interprets mind-body research about healing in her own terms. This creates a foundation for her two central ideas: Our predicaments are the result of our choices. The way we choose to react to what happens to us (whether a life-threatening illness, an addiction, or an unhealthy relationship) allows us to "find the sacred meaning of everything that happens to us." Judd's personal stories are, by turns, charming, feisty and insightful. But she has also done her homework to create a portrait of the "survivor personality." She uses birth-order studies to talk about family conflict and neurochemistry research to explain the role of emotions in building a healthy immune system. Judd explores goal setting, money managing, risk taking, healthy eating and loving relationships with her change-your-mind-to-change-your-world approach. The dark side of her optimism is the arguable contrast of victim/volunteer: implying that we are wholly responsible for our illness and recovery. In addition, few readers will have a superstar's resources (including access to physicians and the love and songs of thousands of fans). But Judd's generous gifts of knowledge and wise kindness offer many treasures. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i><b>Naomi Judd,</b> a country music superstar as well as one of the most admired women in the entertainment industry, has sold more than twenty million albums and won six Grammys and American Music awards.

The book opens with Lion intently painting a picture, when Bear sneaks up and tags him, in hopes of starting this game with his friend. Annoyed Lion does not join in, but Bear gets Tiger to play instead. Lion still does not want to play when Tiger tags him. Lion even makes a wall out of sticks so his friends will get the message. "Lion made himself extremely unavailable." Tiger and Bear continue playing tag by themselves but eventually try double teaming Lion in hopes he will change his mind. But this doesn't work, either. "PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE! I do NOT want to play! I just want to finish my painting!" Tiger then asks, "Okay but do you promise you'll play when you're done?" Lion agrees.

Never again would a single warlord, raiding across the steppes, be able to unite Eurasia under his rule. After Tamerlane, a series of huge, stable empires were founded and consolidated&#x2015; Chinese, Mughal, Persian, and Ottoman&#x2015;realms of such grandeur, sophistication, and dynamism that they outclassed the fragmentary, quarrelsome nations of Europe in every respect. The nineteenth century saw these empires fall vulnerable to European conquest, creating an age of anarchy and exploitation, but this had largely ended by the twenty-first century, with new Chinese and Indian super-states and successful independent states in Turkey and Iran. </p><p>This elegantly written, magisterial account challenges the conventional narrative of the "Rise of the West," showing that European ascendancy was neither foreordained nor a linear process. Indeed, it is likely to be a transitory phase. <i>After Tamerlane </i>is a vivid, bold, and innovative history of how empires rise and fall, from one of Britain's leading scholars. It will take its place beside other provocative works of "large history," from Paul Kennedy's <i>The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers </i>to David Landes's <i>The Wealth and Poverty of Nations </i>or Niall Ferguson's <i>Empire</i>.</p></p><p><p><b>John Darwin </b>is a university lecturer and a fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford. Britain's preeminent scholar of global history, he is the author of <i>Britain and Decolonization</i>, <i>The End of the British Empire</i>, and <i>Britain, Egypt and the Middle East</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Undoubtedly a great work, a book that goes truly global in chronicling the history of one of our abiding concerns: the pull and limitations of absolute power. It forces the reader to rethink commonly held assumptions about our collective past. For that alone, it should be read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Vikram Johri, St. Petersburg Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Nicely balanced between sweeping overview and illuminating detail, this lucid survey complicates and deepens our understanding of modern world history.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this marvellously illuminating book, John Darwin accepts much but not all of the revisionist analysis. With an awesome grasp of global history, he demonstrates that the continental peninsula of Europe was peripheral for most of the time since the 14th-century conquests of Tamerlane...Darwin sustains an intricate thesis with enormous panache.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Piers Brendon, The Independent, 4 May 2007</i></p><p>&#x201c;An astonishingly comprehensive, arrestingly fresh and vivid history of the forces that underlie the world we live in today, After Tamerlane sets aside ideologies in which European power - sometimes seen as liberating and at others as diabolically oppressive - is the driving force of modern development...After reading this masterpiece of historical writing, one thing is clear. The world has not seen the last empire.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John Gray, Literary Review, April 2007</i></p><p>&#x201c;A work of massive erudition, After Tamerlane overturns smug Eurocentric teleologies to present a compelling new perspective on international history. Though the subject of empire stirs partisan passions these days, Darwin exudes fairmindedness...Big topics demand big treatments, yet few are brave or knowledgeable enough to hazard them. Darwin has provided an ambitious, monumental and convincing reminder that empires are the rule, not the exception, in world history. &#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Maya Jasanoff, Guardian, 12 May 2007</i></p><p>&#x201c;A wonderful and imaginative addition to the select library of books on world history that one really wants to possess, and dip into, for ever...It is rather wonderful to doff one's hat to a historian who can range across time and space, giving the reader continual cause for pause, in the way that Darwin has done.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Paul Kennedy, Sunday Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Darwin `gives us world history on the grand scale, equipping his readers with the knowledge and insights to make their own assessment of what is coming next. If only his book could find its way into the right hands, it might also serve to make the world a less dangerous place.' &#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Tim Blanning, Sunday Telegraph</i></p></p><h2>Harcourt School Publishers Reflections: Student Edition Grade 3 Reflections 2007</h2><p>2007 [Harcourt California Series] Reflections Grade 3: Our Communities (CA)(H) by Priscilla H.

This is the number of your fate.</p><p>Three?</p><p>Yes, three is mystic. Three stands at the heart of the mantra.</p><p>Which three?</p><p>The first is dark-haired. He stands on the brink of robbery and murder. A demon has infested him. The name of the demon is HEROIN.</p><p>Which demon is that? I know it not, even from nursery stories.</p><p>He tried to speak but his voice was gone, the voice of the oracle, Star-Slut, Whore of the Winds, both were gone; he saw a card fluttering down from nowhere to nowhere, turning and turning in the lazy dark. On it a baboon grinned from over the shoulder of a young man with dark hair; its disturbingly human fingers were buried so deeply in the young man's neck that their tips had disappeared in flesh. Looking more closely, the gunslinger saw the baboon held a whip in one of those clutching, strangling hands. The face of the ridden man seemed to writhe in wordless terror.</p><p>The Prisoner, the man in black (who had once been a man the gunslinger trusted, a man named Walter) whispered chummily. A trifle upsetting, isn't he? A trifle upsetting ... a trifle upsetting ... a trifle-</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>The gunslinger snapped awake, waving at something with his mutilated hand, sure that in a moment one of the monstrous shelled things from the Western Sea would drop on him, desperately enquiring in its foreign tongue as it pulled his face off his skull.</p><p>Instead a sea-bird, attracted by the glister of the morning sun on the buttons of his shirt, wheeled away with a frightened squawk.</p><p>Roland sat up.</p><p>His hand throbbed wretchedly, endlessly. His right foot did the same. Both fingers and toe continued to insist they were there. The bottom half of his shirt was gone; what was left resembled a ragged vest. He had used one piece to bind his hand, the other to bind his foot.</p><p>Go away, he told the absent parts of his body. You are ghosts now. Go away.</p><p>It helped a little. Not much, but a little. They were ghosts, all right, but lively ghosts.</p><p>The gunslinger ate jerky. His mouth wanted it little, his stomach less, but he insisted. When it was inside him, he felt a little stronger. There was not much left, though; he was nearly up against it.</p><p>Yet things needed to be done.</p><p>He rose unsteadily to his feet and looked about. Birds swooped and dived, but the world seemed to belong to only him and them. The monstrosities were gone. Perhaps they were nocturnal; perhaps tidal. At the moment it seemed to make no difference.</p><p>The sea was enormous, meeting the horizon at a misty blue point that was impossible to determine. For a long moment the gunslinger forgot his agony in its contemplation. He had never seen such a body of water. Had heard of it in children's stories, of course, had even been assured by his teachers-some, at least-that it existed-but to actually see it, this immensity, this amazement of water after years of arid land, was difficult to accept ... difficult to even see.</p><p>He looked at it for a long time, enrapt, making himself see it, temporarily forgetting his pain in wonder.</p><p>But it was morning, and there were still things to be done.</p><p>He felt for the jawbone in his back pocket, careful to lead with the palm of his right hand, not wanting the stubs of his fingers to encounter it if it was still there, changing that hand's ceaseless sobbing to screams.</p><p>It was.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Next.</p><p>He clumsily unbuckled his gunbelts and laid them on a sunny rock. He removed the guns, swung the chambers out, and removed the useless shells. He threw them away. A bird settled on the bright gleam tossed back by one of them, picked it up in its beak, then dropped it and flew away.</p><p>The guns themselves must be tended to, should have been tended to before this, but since no gun in this world or any other was more than a club without ammunition, he laid the gunbelts themselves over his lap before doing anything else and carefully ran his left hand over the leather.</p><p>Each of them was damp from buckle and clasp to the point where the belts would cross his hips; from that point they seemed dry. He carefully removed each shell from the dry portions of the belts. His right hand kept trying to do this job, insisted on forgetting its reduction in spite of the pain, and he found himself returning it to his knee again and again, like a dog too stupid or fractious to heel. In his distracted pain he came close to swatting it once or twice.</p><p>I see serious problems ahead, he thought again.</p><p>He put these shells, hopefully still good, in a pile that was dishearteningly small. Twenty. Of those, a few would almost certainly misfire. He could depend on none of them. He removed the rest and put them in another pile. Thirty-seven.</p><p>Well, you weren't heavy loaded, anyway, he thought, but he recognized the difference between fifty-seven live rounds and what might be twenty. Or ten. Or five. Or one. Or none.</p><p>He put the dubious shells in a second pile.</p><p>He still had his purse. That was one thing. He put it in his lap and then slowly disassembled his guns and performed the ritual of cleaning. By the time he was finished, two hours had passed and his pain was so intense his head reeled with it; conscious thought had become difficult. He wanted to sleep. He had never wanted that more in his life. But in the service of duty there was never any acceptable reason for denial.</p><p>"Cort," he said in a voice that he couldn't recognize, and laughed dryly.</p><p>Slowly, slowly, he reassembled his revolvers and loaded them with the shells he presumed to be dry. When the job was done, he held the one made for his left hand, cocked it ... and then slowly lowered the hammer again. He wanted to know, yes. Wanted to know if there would be a satisfying report when he squeezed the trigger or only another of those useless clicks. But a click would mean nothing, and a report would only reduce twenty to nineteen ... or nine ... or three ... or none.</p><p>He tore away another piece of his shirt, put the other shells-the ones which had been wetted-in it, and tied it, using his left hand and his teeth. He put them in his purse.</p><p>Sleep, his body demanded. Sleep, you must sleep, now, before dark, there's nothing left, you're used up- He tottered to his feet and looked up and down the deserted strand. It was the color of an undergarment which has gone a long time without washing, littered with sea-shells which had no color. Here and there large rocks protruded from the gross-grained sand, and these were covered with guano, the older layers the yellow of ancient teeth, the fresher splotches white.</p><p>The high-tide line was marked with drying kelp. He could see pieces of his right boot and his waterskins lying near that line. He thought it almost a miracle that the skins hadn't been washed out to sea by high-surging waves. Walking slowly, limping exquisitely, the gunslinger made his way to where they were. He picked up one of them and shook it by his ear. The other was empty. This one still had a little water left in it. Most would not have been able to tell the difference between the two, but the gunslinger knew each just as well as a mother knows which of her identical twins is which. He had been travelling with these waterskins for a long, long time. Water sloshed inside. That was good-a gift. Either the creature which had attacked him or any of the others could have torn this or the other open with one casual bite or slice of claw, but none had and the tide had spared it. Of the creature itself there was no sign, although the two of them had finished far above the tide-line. Perhaps other predators had taken it; perhaps its own kind had given it a burial at sea, as the elaphaunts, giant creatures of whom he had heard in childhood stories, were reputed to bury their own dead.</p><p>He lifted the waterskin with his left elbow, drank deeply, and felt some strength come back into him. The right boot was of course ruined ... but then he felt a spark of hope. The foot itself was intact-scarred but intact-and it might be possible to cut the other down to match it, to make something which would last at least awhile.... Faintness stole over him. He fought it but his knees unhinged and he sat down, stupidly biting his tongue.</p><p>You won't fall unconscious, he told himself grimly. Not here, not where another of those things can come back tonight and finish the job.</p><p>So he got to his feet and tied the empty skin about his waist, but he had only gone twenty yards back toward the place where he had left his guns and purse when he fell down again, half-fainting. He lay there awhile, one cheek pressed against the sand, the edge of a seashell biting against the edge of his jaw almost deep enough to draw blood. He managed to drink from the waterskin, and then he crawled back to the place where he had awakened. There was a Joshua tree twenty yards up the slope-it was stunted, but it would offer at least some shade.</p><p>To Roland the twenty yards looked like twenty miles.</p><p>Nonetheless, he laboriously pushed what remained of his possessions into that little puddle of shade. He lay there with his head in the grass, already fading toward what could be sleep or unconsciousness or death. He looked into the sky and tried to judge the time. Not noon, but the size of the puddle of shade in which he rested said noon was close. He held on a moment longer, turning his right arm over and bringing it close to his eyes, looking for the telltale red lines of infection, of some poison seeping steadily toward the middle of him.</p><p>The palm of his hand was a dull red. Not a good sign.</p><p>I jerk off left-handed, he thought, at least that's something.</p><p>Then darkness took him, and he slept for the next sixteen hours with the sound of the Western Sea pounding ceaselessly in his dreaming ears.</p><p><b>3</b></p><p>When the gunslinger awoke again the sea was dark but there was faint light in the sky to the east. Morning was on its way. He sat up and waves of dizziness almost overcame him.</p><p>He bent his head and waited.</p><p>When the faintness had passed, he looked at his hand. It was infected, all right-a tell-tale red swelling that spread up the palm and to the wrist. It stopped there, but already he could see the faint beginnings of other red lines, which would lead eventually to his heart and kill him. He felt hot, feverish.</p><p>I need medicine, he thought. But there is no medicine here.</p><p>Had he come this far just to die, then? He would not. And if he were to die in spite of his determination, he would die on his way to the Tower.</p><p>How remarkable you are, gunslinger! the man in black tittered inside his head. How indomitable! How romantic in your stupid obsession!</p><p>"Fuck you," he croaked, and drank. Not much water left, either. There was a whole sea in front of him, for all the good it could do him; water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink. Never mind.</p><p>He buckled on his gunbelts, tied them-this was a process which took so long that before he was done the first faint light of dawn had brightened to the day's actual prologue-and then tried to stand up. He was not convinced he could do it until it was done.</p><p>Holding to the Joshua tree with his left hand, he scooped up the not-quite-empty waterskin with his right arm and slung it over his shoulder. Then his purse. When he straightened, the faintness washed over him again and he put his head down, waiting, willing.</p><p>The faintness passed.</p><p>Walking with the weaving, wavering steps of a man in the last stages of ambulatory drunkenness, the gunslinger made his way back down to the strand. He stood, looking at an ocean as dark as mulberry wine, and then took the last of his jerky from his purse. He ate half, and this time both mouth and stomach accepted a little more willingly. He turned and ate the other half as he watched the sun come up over the mountains where Jake had died-first seeming to catch on the cruel and treeless teeth of those peaks, then rising above them.</p><p>Roland held his face to the sun, closed his eyes, and smiled. He ate the rest of his jerky.</p><p>He thought: Very well. I am now a man with no food, with two less fingers and one less toe than I was born with; I am a gunslinger with shells which may not fire; I am sickening from a monster's bite and have no medicine; I have a day's water if I'm lucky; I may be able to walk perhaps a dozen miles if I press myself to the last extremity. I am, in short, a man on the edge of everything.</p><p>Which way should he walk? He had come from the east; he could not walk west without the powers of a saint or a savior. That left north and south.</p><p>North.</p><p>That was the answer his heart told. There was no question in it.</p><p>North.</p><p>The gunslinger began to walk.</p><p><b>4</b></p><p>He walked for three hours. He fell twice, and the second time he did not believe he would be able to get up again. Then a wave came toward him, close enough to make him remember his guns, and he was up before he knew it, standing on legs that quivered like stilts.</p><p>He thought he had managed about four miles in those three hours. Now the sun was growing hot, but not hot enough to explain the way his head pounded or the sweat pouring down his face; nor was the breeze from the sea strong enough to explain the sudden fits of shuddering which sometimes gripped him, making his body lump into gooseflesh and his teeth chatter.</p><p>Fever, gunslinger, the man in black tittered. What's left inside you has been touched afire.</p><p>The red lines of infection were more pronounced now; they had marched upward from his right wrist halfway to his elbow.</p><p>He made another mile and drained his waterbag dry. He tied it around his waist with the other. The landscape was monotonous and unpleasing. The sea to his right, the mountains to his left, the gray, shell-littered sand under the feet of his cut-down boots. The waves came and went. He looked for the lobstrosities and saw none. He walked out of nowhere toward nowhere, a man from another time who, it seemed, had reached a point of pointless ending.</p><p>Shortly before noon he fell again and knew he could not get up. This was the place, then. Here. This was the end, after all.</p><p>On his hands and knees, he raised his head like a groggy fighter ... and some distance ahead, perhaps a mile, perhaps three (it was difficult to judge distances along the unchanging reach of the strand with the fever working inside him, making his eyeballs pulse in and out), he saw something new. Something which stood upright on the beach.</p><p>What was it?</p><p>(three)</p><p>Didn't matter.</p><p>(three is the number of your fate)</p><p>The gunslinger managed to get to his feet again. He croaked something, some plea which only the circling seabirds heard (and how happy they would be to gobble my eyes from my head, he thought, how happy to have such a tasty bit!), and walked on, weaving more seriously now, leaving tracks behind him that were weird loops and swoops.</p><p>He kept his eyes on whatever it was that stood on the strand ahead. When his hair fell in his eyes he brushed it aside. It seemed to grow no closer. The sun reached the roof of the sky, where it seemed to remain far too long.

The other story in this volume also involves Battle Meditation, which Jedi Master Arca uses to save the hides of his young charges Ulic Qel-Droma and friends, who are sent to forge a peace between the beastmaster warlords and walled-city defenders on war-torn Onderon.<p> With plenty of twists, tons of action, and monsters and bad guys at every turn, these two stories are fully worth checking out, although purists be warned: the Ulic tale especially tends more toward the Jedi-as-superhero school of storytelling.

When she was almost 2 years old, Louisa's family moved to Massachusetts, the state where she lived the bulk of her life. The family moved many times over the years, usually back and forth between Boston and Concord (Mass.). Some notable places Louisa lived were "Fruitlands" in Harvard, Massachusetts; "Hillside" in Concord; and "Orchard House," also in Concord. "Fruitlands" was the site of her father's attempt at Utopian living, which she wrote about in <b>Transcendental Wild Oats</b>, thirty years later in 1873. Louisa's childhood at "Hillside" (later renamed "Wayside" by Nathaniel Hawthorne, when he lived there) served as the basis for the action in her most popular novel, <b>Little Women</b>, which she wrote as an adult living in "Orchard House." Interestingly, these latter two houses were located next door to each other, with a walking path through the woods between. They are both still standing and open for tours in Concord.<p>Louisa May Alcott's father, Amos Bronson Alcott, was an important--though controversial--man in his times and in his community. He is perhaps best known for being a philosopher and an education reformer, but he was also a leader in the Transcendentalist movement as well as a teacher, school superintendent, and an author. He established both the Temple School, in Boston, and the Concord School of Philosophy. Although he was a loving father, he was not very responsible or practical, so Louisa's mother, Abigail May Alcott, filled the role of "head of household". Just like Jo, the protagonist in her <b>Little Women</b>, Louisa had three sisters--one older (Anna Bronson Alcott) and two younger (Elizabeth "Lizzie" Sewall Alcott and Abba May Alcott). And, much like Jo's sister Beth, Lizzie died at age 22 from complications of scarlet fever. But, unlike Jo, Louisa also had a little brother, who died as an infant.</p><p>Louisa May Alcott was a versatile writer who started at an early age. At the encouragement of her father, she kept a diary as a child--which probably helped her to discover her love and talent for writing and surely provided ideas later for her various plots and characters. As a teenager, Louisa wrote several plays, poems, and short stories. She achieved publication for the first time at age nineteen, with a poem entitled "Sunlight" (1851), which she wrote under the pseudonym, "Flora Fairfield." The title of Ms. Alcott's first published short story was <i>The Rival Painters: A Tale of Rome</i> (1852), and her first published book was <b>Flower Fables</b> (1854), a collection of short fairy-tale stories and poems which she had originally created to entertain Ralph Waldo Emerson's daughter Ellen. Louisa May Alcott wrote her first novel, <b>The Inheritance</b>, at age seventeen, but it went unpublished for nearly 150 years until 1997, after two researchers (Joel Myerson and Daniel Shealy) stumbled across the handwritten manuscript in the Houghton Library at Harvard University. Of course, Ms. Alcott is best known for a different novel, <b>Little Women</b>, which she wrote in two parts. The first volume, alternately titled <b>Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy</b>, was published in 1868, and the second volume, <b>Good Wives</b>, was published in 1869. Like Jo in <b>Little Women</b>, Louisa also wrote many "blood and thunder" tales, which were published in popular periodicals of the day. She did not openly claim authorship for many of these Gothic thriller stories, however: for some, she used the pseudonym, "A. M. Barnard"; for others, she chose to remain completely anonymous.</p><p>Louisa May Alcott's career was not restricted to writing. Beginning in her late teens, she worked as a teacher for several years and off-and-on as a seamstress. In December of 1862, at age 30, she traveled to Washington, DC, to serve as a Civil War nurse at the Union Hotel Hospital in Georgetown. The following year, she re-wrote her letters detailing that experience, to form Hospital Sketches, which was published first serially and then as a book. And, in the winter of 1867/68, Ms. Alcott became the editor of <i>Merry's Museum</i>, a children's magazine. Louisa Alcott also was an avid social reformer. Abolition, temperance, and educational reform were among her chosen causes. But being a feminist at heart, she especially fought for women's rights, including suffrage. In fact, she was the first woman to register to vote in Concord. Unlike Jo in her <b>Little Women</b>, Louisa May Alcott never married. She died at age 55 on March 6, 1888, (two days after her father) and is buried on "Authors' Ridge" in Concord's Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, with her family. Nearby are the graves of her friends and mentors Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau.</p></p><h2>Dead Lions: Jackson Lamb Thriller 2</h2><p>Dead Lions</p><p>Mick Herron is a novelist and short story writer whose books include the Slough House series, the first of which - the Steel-Dagger nominated Slow Horses - has been described as the &#39;most enjoyable British spy novel in years&#39;. The second Slough House novel, Dead Lions, won the 2013 CWA Goldsboro Gold Dagger, and was picked by the Sunday Times as one of the best 25 crime novels of the past five years. Mick was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, and now lives in Oxford.A fuse had blown in Swindon, so the south-west network ground to a halt. In Paddington the monitors wiped departure times, flagging everything &#x2018;Delayed&#x2019;, and stalled trains clogged the platforms; on the concourse luckless travellers clustered round suitcases, while seasoned commuters repaired to the pub, or rang home with cast-iron alibis before hooking up with their lovers back in the city. And thirty-six minutes outside London, a Worcester-bound HST crawled to a halt on a bare stretch of track with a view of the Thames. Lights from houseboats pooled on the river&#x2019;s surface, illuminating a pair of canoes which whipped out of sight even as Dickie Bow registered them: two frail crafts built for speed, furrowing the water on a chilly March evening.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All about, passengers were muttering, checking watches, making calls. Pulling himself into character, Dickie Bow made an exasperated <i>tch</i>! But he wore no watch, and had no calls to make. He didn&#x2019;t know where he was headed, and didn&#x2019;t have a ticket.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three seats away the hood fiddled with his briefcase.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The intercom fizzed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This is your train manager speaking. I&#x2019;m sorry to have to inform you we can&#x2019;t go any further due to trackside equipment failure outside Swindon. We&#x2019;re currently&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A crackle of static and the voice died, though could faintly be heard continuing to broadcast in neighbouring carriages. Then it returned:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;&#x2014;reverse into Reading, where replacement buses will&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was met with a communal groan of disgust, and not a little swearing, but most impressively to Dickie Bow, immediate readiness. The message hadn&#x2019;t ended before coats were being pulled on and laptops folded; bags snapped shut and seats vacated. The train shunted, and then the river was flowing in the wrong direction, and Reading station was appearing once more.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was chaos as passengers disgorged onto crowded platforms, then realised they didn&#x2019;t know where to go. Nor did Dickie Bow, but all he cared about was the hood, who had immediately disappeared in a sea of bodies. Dickie, though, was too old a hand<br>to panic. It was all coming back to him. He might never have left the Spooks&#x2019; Zoo.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except in those days he&#x2019;d have found a patch of wall and smoked a cigarette. Not possible here, which didn&#x2019;t stop a nicotine pang twitching inside him, or a sudden wasp-sharp sting pricking his thigh, so real he gasped. He gripped the spot, his hand brushing first the corner of an oblivious briefcase, then an umbrella&#x2019;s slick damp nastiness. Deadly weapons, he thought. Your nine-tofivers carry deadly weapons.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was crowded onwards, like it or not&#x2014;, and suddenly everything was okay, because he&#x2019;d secured visible contact once more: the hood, a hat shielding his bald head, his case tucked under an arm, stood near the escalator to the passenger bridge.<br>So, corralled by weary travellers, Dickie shuffled past and up the moving stairs, at the top of which he sidled into a corner. The main exit from the station was across this bridge. He assumed that was the route everyone would take, once instructions about buses were issued.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He closed his eyes. Today was not ordinary. Usually by this time, just after six thirty, all sharp edges would have been smoothed away: he&#x2019;d have been up since twelve, after five hours&#x2019; stormy shut-eye. Black coffee and a fag in his room. A shower if needed. Then the Star, where a Guinness and whisky chaser would either set him right or serve him notice that solids were best avoided. His hardcore days were over. Back then, he&#x2019;d had his unreliable moments: drunk, he&#x2019;d mistaken nuns for whores and policemen for friends; sober, he&#x2019;d made eye-contact with ex-wives, no recognition on his side, and only relief on theirs. Bad times.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even then, he&#x2019;d never had a gold-standard Moscow hood shimmy past without clocking him for what he was.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dickie became aware of action: an announcement about buses had been made, and everyone was trying to cross the bridge. He hung by the monitor long enough for the hood to pass, then allowed himself to be carried forward, three warm bodies behind. He shouldn&#x2019;t be this close, but there was no accounting for the choreography of crowds.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this crowd was not happy. Having squeezed through the ticket barriers on the other side, it hassled the station staff, who placated, argued, and pointed at the exits. Outside was wet and dark, and there were no buses. The crowd swelled across the forecourt. Crushed in its embrace, Dickie Bow kept both eyes on the hood, who stood placidly, waiting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An interrupted journey, thought Dickie. You played the odds in this line of work&#x2014;he had forgotten he was no longer in this line of work&#x2014;and the hood would have finished processing them before getting off the train; he would go with the flow, make no<br>fuss; continue on his way by whatever means presented. Where this might be, Dickie had no idea. The train had been Worcesterbound, but made plenty of stops before then. The hood could be getting off anywhere. All Dickie knew was, he&#x2019;d be getting off there too.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now there were buses, three of them, pulling round the corner. The crowd tensed, pressed forward, and the hood sailed through the mass like an icebreaker carving an Arctic field, while Dickie slipped through spaces in his wake. Someone was calling instructions, but didn&#x2019;t have the voice for it. Long before he&#x2019;d finished, he was drowned out by the muttering of people who couldn&#x2019;t hear.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the hood knew what was what. The hood was heading for the third bus, so Dickie sidled through chaos in his wake, and boarded it too. Nobody asked for a ticket. Dickie simply trotted on and headed for the rear, which boasted a view of the hood, two<br>seats ahead. Settling back, Dickie allowed his eyes to close. In every operation came a lull. When it did, you shut your eyes and took inventory. He was miles from home, with about sixteen quid on him. He needed a drink, and wouldn&#x2019;t get one in a hurry. But on the upside, he was here, it was now, and he hadn&#x2019;t known how much he&#x2019;d missed this: living life, instead of easing through it on the wet stuff.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which was what he&#x2019;d been doing when he&#x2019;d spotted the hood. Right there in the Star. A civilian&#x2019;s jaw would have hit the table: what the hell? A pro, even a long-defunct pro, checked the clock, drained his Guinness, folded the Post and left. Loitered by the bookies two doors down, remembering the last time he&#x2019;d seen that face, and in whose company. The hood was a bit player. The hood had held the bottle, poured its contents directly into Dickie&#x2019;s clamped-wide mouth; strictly a non-speaking role. It wasn&#x2019;t the hood who sent electric shivers down Dickie&#x2019;s spine . . . Ten minutes later he emerged, and Dickie fell into step behind him: Dickie, who could follow a ferret through a wood let alone a leftover ghost. A blast from the past. An echo from the Spooks&#x2019; Zoo.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Berlin, if you insisted. The Spooks&#x2019; Zoo was Berlin, back when the cages had just been unlocked, and frightened thugs were pouring from the woodwork like beetles from an upturned log. At least twice a day, some sweating would-be asset was at the door claiming to have the crown jewels in a cardboard suitcase: defence details, missile capability, toxic secrets&#x2014;and yet, for all the flurry of activity, the writing was on the newly dismantled Wall: everyone&#x2019;s past had been blown away, but so had Dickie Bow&#x2019;s future. Thanks, old chap. Afraid there&#x2019;s not much call for your, ah, skills any more . . . What pension? So naturally, he&#x2019;d drifted back to London.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The driver called something Dickie didn&#x2019;t catch. The door hissed shut and the horn was tapped twice; a farewell note to the lingering buses. Dickie rubbed his thigh where the edge of a briefcase or umbrella-tip had nipped him, and thought about luck,<br>and the strange places it dragged you. Such as, from a Soho street into the tube and out the other end; into Paddington, onto a train, then onto this bus. He still didn&#x2019;t know whether that luck was good or bad.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the lights went out the bus briefly became a travelling shadow. Then passengers switched overhead bulbs on, and blue screens gleamed upwards from laptops, and fists wrapped round iPhones grew spectrally white. Dickie fiddled his own phone from his pocket, but he had no messages. There were never any messages. Scrolling through his contact list, he was struck by how short it was. Two seats in front, the hood had rolled his newspaper into a baton, wedged it between his knees, and hung his hat upon it. He might be asleep.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bus left Reading behind. Through the window, dark countryside unfurled. Some distance off, an ascending sequence of red lights indicated the mast at Didcot, but the cooling towers were invisible.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Dickie&#x2019;s hand, the mobile was a grenade. Rubbing his thumb on its numberpad, he registered the tiny nipple on the middle button that allowed you to orient your fingers in the dark. But nobody was hanging on Dickie&#x2019;s words. Dickie was a relic.<br>The world had moved on, and what would his message be anyway? That he&#x2019;d seen a face from the past, and was following it home? Who would have cared? The world had moved on. It had left him behind.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rejection came softer these days. Dickie heard occasional whispers on the Soho songlines, and these days even the useless were given a chance. The Service, like everyone else, was hamstrung by rules and regulations: sack the useless, and they took you to tribunal for discriminating against useless people. So the Service bunged the useless into some godforsaken annex and threw paperwork at them, an administrative harassment intended to make them hand in their cards. They called them the slow horses. The screw-ups. The losers. They called them the slow horses and they belonged to Jackson Lamb, whom Dickie had encountered, back in the Spooks&#x2019; Zoo.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mobile gave a blip, but there was no message; only a warning that it was running out of power.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dickie knew how it felt. He had nothing to say. Attention wavered and refocused elsewhere. Laptops hummed and mobiles whispered, but Dickie had no voice. Had no movement, bar a feeble flexing of his fingers. The tiny nipple on the keypad&#x2019;s middle button scratched beneath his thumb: <i>scratch scratch</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was an important message to deliver, but Dickie did not know what it was, nor to whom it should be sent. For a few luminous moments he was aware of being part of a warm, humid community, breathing the same air, hearing the same tune. But the tune slipped out of earshot, and became beyond recall. Everything faded, save the scene through the window. The landscape continued unrolling one black fold after another, dotted with pinpricks of light, like sequins on a scarf. And then the lights blurred and dimmed and the darkness rolled over itself one final time, and then there was only the bus carrying its mortal cargo through the night, heading for Oxford, where it would deliver one soul fewer than it had gathered, back in the rain.</p><h2>Bad Optics (Wood Cop Mystery)</h2><p>In the eleventh Woods Cop Mystery, Conservation Officer Grady Service is on unpaid suspension until spring, but&#x2014;stubborn as ever&#x2014;continues to patrol the Mosquito Wilderness, along with his complicated past. Service is off-duty through July 4 following a season in which Service and his unofficial partner (lifelong poacher Limpy Allerdyce) cleaned up on deer-law violators and poachers, closing more big cases in two weeks than most officers solve in their careers. His reward? He is summoned to Lansing, told he is on unpaid suspension, his badge, firearms, and truck taken. The rationale for the action is fuzzy, a questioning of his using a lifelong lawbreaker as partner. For the first time, Service has no duties and feels like he has been beached unfairly. But voluntarily on patrol, he begins to sense political shenanigans<br>&#x2013;an old foe lurking somewhere in the shadows. He could retire, but decides to fight, and enlists help from Allerdyce and fellow game warden and Vietnam Veteran Luticious Treebone. Clues accumulate: It seems someone wants to illegally commercialize the Mosquito. Grady realizes if he doesn&#x2019;t stop it, the wilderness will be destroyed. The tight story unfolds like a poker game, with one side bluffing and raising, while the other side keeps calling and keeping the game on until there is a final showdown.</p><p>Joseph Heywood is the author of The Snowfly, Covered Waters, The Berkut, Taxi Dancer, The Domino Conspiracy, the ten previous Woods Cop Mysteries, Hard Ground: Woods Cop Stories, Harder Ground, and the Lute Bapcat Mysteries Red Jacket and Mountains of the Misbegotten.

Whyte's focus, however, is on Caius Merlyn Britannicus. Merlyn, descended from Britain's Roman rulers, is one of the co-rulers of Camulod, a stronghold of civilization under perpetual threat from invading Saxons and Danes. Merlyn leads an eventful yet happy life: he has a loving fiancj�e, Tressa; a fine ward, Arthur; a magnificent black horse, Germanicus; many allies; and grand plans for Camulod's expansion and Britain's safety. Merlyn's reflections on one campaign sum up his easy victories throughout the first half of the book: "It was slaughter--nothing less. One pass we made, from west to east, and scarce a living man was left to face us."<p> But even the mightiest ship must one day be tested on the shoals. The suspense gains momentum when Whyte breaks Merlyn free of his brooding, reactive role and propels him and his companions into danger. In despair, Merlyn takes a new, subtler tack against his archenemies Ironhair and Carthac ("And then I truly saw the size of him. He towered over everyone about him, hulking and huge, his shoulders leviathan and his great, deep, hairless chest unarmoured"). </p><p> Whyte shines at interpreting the mythos of Camelot in a surprising yet believable way. He can squeeze a sword out of a stone without opting for the glib explanations of fantasy-land magic. The Camulod Chronicles, and <i>The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis</i> in particular, provide an engaging take on the chivalric world of knights and High Kings. <i>--Blaise Selby</i></p>Throughout the widely praised Camulod Chronicles, Merlyn Britannicus has been driven by one sacred dream -- to see Britain united under one just, powerful king. In The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis, it is time for the Sorcerer to fulfill his promise -- to present the battle-proven Arthur as the Riothamus, the High King of Britain. When Arthur miraculously withdraws the Sword of Kingship from the stone in which it is set, he proves himself the true and deserving King -- sworn to defend the Christian faith against invaders, and to preserve Britain as a powerful, united force.<p>The Sorcerer has fulfilled his promise. The King is crowned, Britain is united -- and the face of history and legend is forever changed.</p></p><h2>Holy Bible, New International Version: Standard Reference Bible, Red Letter, No 81000</h2><p>Holy Bible New International Version: Standard Reference Bible, Red Letter</p><p></p><h2>In the American Grain</h2><p><p><strong>Although admired by D.

Rife with wisdom born of unparalleled experience and filled with the caustic candor that has made him a living legend on &#x201c;the Twitter Machine,&#x201d; <em>The Dean</em> is the inside story of the greatest legislative achievements in modern American history and of the tough fights that made them possible. </p><p>Here Dingell looks back at his life at the center of American government and vividly describes the political currents that swirled through Congress and the nation. At the age of fifteen, Dingell was in the House Chamber on December 8, 1941, and personally heard President Roosevelt declare it &#x201c;a date which will live in infamy.&#x201d; Almost a quarter century later, he presided over the House when Medicare was passed and led the health care reform effort in the House of Representatives from his first term in 1955 through the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, when President Obama invited Dingell to sit at the table when the bill was signed into law. </p><p>Congressman Dingell worked closely alongside some of the most legendary names in American politics, including Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Barack Obama; Vice Presidents Hubert Humphrey and Joseph Biden; Senator Ted Kennedy; and House Speakers Sam Rayburn and John McCormack. And though he is a lifelong, proud Democrat, Dingell built lasting bipartisan friendships with Republican leaders such as Presidents Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush, Secretary of State James Baker, and Senator Alan Simpson.</p><p>And in a scathingly powerful afterword, Dingell addresses our nation&#x2019;s future in the wake of an unprecedented attack on all our democratic institutions. He presents a persuasive defense of government, reminding us how it once worked honorably and well across the aisle, and offers hope for how it can do so again. By sharing his personal story as a descendant of immigrants, Dingell also reminds us of this country&#x2019;s founding promise to remain a beacon of liberty to the entire world. <em>The Dean</em> is essential reading for all who love this country as deeply as John D. Dingell does.</p>John David Dingell Jr. (born July 8, 1926) is an American politician who was a member of the United States House of Representatives from December 13, 1955, until January 3, 2015. served as a House Page and attended the Capitol Page School from 1938 to 1943. In 1944, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, where he served until receiving an honorable discharge in 1946 after World War II. When his father passed away in 1955, Dingell won the special election to succeed him in the House on December 13, 1955. Though decennial reapportionment reshaped the borders of his district over time, Dingell was re-elected to office for an historic 29 additional terms. During his House career, Dingell rose to the powerful chairmanship of the Energy and Commerce Committee (97th-103rd Congresses and 110th Congress; 1981-1995 and 2007-2009). As such, he played a highly influential role in legislation ranging from the automobile industry and energy policy, to the environment and health care. When Dingell retired at the end of the 113th Congress (2013-2015), he held the record as the longest serving Member in congressional history-with a total of 21,572 days in office-approximately 58.9 years. He lives in Dearborn, Michigan with his wife, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.<br><br><p>David Bender is an author and lifelong political activist who has worked on multiple presidential campaigns since 1968.

Adult or child, we should all be lucky enough to have Bromfield (Psychology/Harvard Medical School) as a therapist. His willingness and ability to understand the emotional turmoil of troubled children and to let them play out their conflicts in his office set an extraordinary standard. ``Play'' is the operative word here. Puppets, dolls, clay, crayons, games, even guns and toy soldiers are the tools that allow psychologists entry into a child's often tumultuous psyche. As the author makes clear, children do not always do what they are expected to do, even with an array of childish treasures before them. On a first visit, seven-year-old Cory scoured the rug for fallen staples; teenaged Judy burrowed down inside her hooded sweatshirt, motionless and speechless for the first hour; fifth-grader Glen covered all the panes on the office's only window. Other patients include a boy diagnosed at school with what used to be called hyperactivity, and a six-year-old girl abused so badly as a toddler that she can only relate to others in a sexual way. More than a collection of readable stories about engaging--and some not so engaging-- patients, this book lays out the case for children's therapy. Along with a discussion of what qualities befit a child therapist--among them, patience and an ability to play--eloquent codicils to each chapter highlight Bromfield's belief that therapy is meant to heal, not to comfort, wounded children. Parents, teachers, and professionals will be informed and reassured by this view of play therapy for real children. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Paul hired Michael as his security guard, beginning a thirty-year music business career in which he worked with such legendary names as Led Zeppelin, Bad Company, The Osmonds, Sheena Easton, Frank Sinatra, Bon Jovi, Cher, and Kiss. As tour manager, Michael was responsible for every aspect of their safety and their comfort, from making sure they were not mobbed on stage to making sure they got paid. To some of them he became close. He was best man at Jon Bon Jovi's wedding, and provided personal security for Cher at her Malibu home. He shared their wildest excesses, their highs and their lows; he saw their fears, and all too often, their loneliness and paranoia. Sometimes hilarious, frequently shocking, always perceptive, <i>Star Man</i> is the outrageous, uncompromising, and brutally honest story of one man's life with the biggest stars of rock.</p><p>The son of world-renowned boxing trainer George Francis, Michael Francis was born and brought up in Camden Town. After thirty years on the road, he quit the music business on his fiftieth birthday when one last event-filled tour with American Superstars Kiss convinced him he&#39;d had enough.

Mencken was the most provocative and influential journalist and cultural critic in twentieth-century America. In this volume and a companion, The Library of America presents all six series of&nbsp;<i>Prejudices</i>&nbsp;(1919&#x2013;1927), the iconoclastic collections that helped blast American literature out of its complacency and into a new age of frankness and maturity. The fantastic linguistic inventiveness, full-bodied humor, and unwaveringly fierce courage of his journalism made him a liberating force for his contemporaries.<br><br>The final three series show Mencken at his lacerating best, taking on targets from religious fundamentalism to the dismal state of higher education. Included are such famous essays as &#x201c;The Hills of Zion,&#x201d; his report on the local atmosphere surrounding the Scopes trial in 1925; &#x201c;In Memoriam: W.J.B.,&#x201d; his relentless postmortem on William Jennings Bryan; &#x201c;The Fringes of Lovely Letters,&#x201d; a hilarious delineation of the lower and outer reaches of the literary world; &#x201c;Comstockery,&#x201d; a devastating account of the anti-obscenity crusader Anthony Comstock (&#x201c;A good woman, to him, was simply one who was efficiently policed&#x201d;); and &#x201c;On Living in Baltimore,&#x201d; a celebration of his beloved native city.<br><br>Mencken was a man of strong enthusiasms and even stronger antipathies, expressed in a prose style that marshaled all the resources of the American language in a rich blend of comic invention and sarcastic fury. To read&nbsp;<i>Prejudices</i>&nbsp;is to embark on an exploration of many curious byways of American culture in a moment of tumultuous and often combative transition. Mencken never shied from combat, and the courage with which he confronted the entrenched truisms and hypocrisies of his time made him a uniquely liberating force in American letter.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

Peterson explains the saving work of Christ, both his deeds and the biblical pictures illustrating them, and thereby points to the magnitude of what Jesus did to save sinners. Offered here is a substantive, significant, and enduring treatise on a key Christian doctrine&#x2015;the work of Christ.</p></p><p><p><strong>Robert A.

Peterson writes with a pastor&#x2019;s heart, as is evident in the biblical fidelity and remarkable clarity that marks this work.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Thomas R. Schreiner,</strong> James Buchanan Harrison Professor of New Testament Interpretation, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;Robert Peterson has produced a comprehensive study of Christ&#x2019;s saving work that puts the cross at the center, but also shows how it is part of a wider plan. He shows how the atonement must be seen in the context of Christ&#x2019;s whole life and ministry without compromising the essential truth of his penal substitutionary sacrifice for us. This is a refreshing and insightful study, which is much needed at the present time and deserves to be widely read.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Gerald Bray, </strong>Research Professor of Divinity, History, and Doctrine, Beeson Divinity School;&nbsp;author, <em>God Is Love </em>and <em>God Has Spoken</em></p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Peterson told me in correspondence, &#x2018;my work is not [systematic theology] as much as laying biblical foundations for systematics.&#x2019; Well, people can define terms as they like. But I think <em>Salvation Accomplished by the Son</em> is systematic theology at its very best. It deals with doctrines of systematic theology by bringing them into closest proximity with the biblical texts that justify them. That is the kind of systematics of which we need much more. To explore any question about Jesus&#x2019;s incarnation, atonement, or resurrection, this is the book to which, after Scripture itself, I would turn first.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John M. Frame,</strong>&nbsp;Professor of Systematic Theology and Philosophy Emeritus, Reformed Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;At the heart of evangelicalism is the simple affirmation &#x2018;Jesus saves.&#x2019; Theologian Robert Peterson shows us that this affirmation is both simple enough for a child&#x2019;s faith and profound enough for a scholar&#x2019;s erudition. In this sweeping and comprehensive study, Peterson not only unpacks the full scope of Christ&#x2019;s saving work, from first advent to second; he pastorally applies this to the believer so that the result is not bone-dry theology, but heart-melting doxology. I left this book with a new desire to sing, &#x2018;Jesus saves!&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Sean Michael Lucas,</strong> Senior Pastor, Independent Presbyterian Church, Memphis, Tennessee; Chancellor&#x2019;s Professor of Church History, Reformed Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;At the center of Christianity is a crucified and risen Savior&#x2015;a person, event, and picture so profound and massive, we have the sixty-six books of the Bible to unpack it. In this book, trusted and reliable guide Robert Peterson leads us deep into the rich contours of the atoning work of Christ. This is theology as it&#x2019;s supposed to be: biblically informed at every turn, historically aware and enriched, culturally engaged, and pastorally presented&#x2015;all leading us to worship the slain and risen Lamb.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Stephen J.

The precious and intricate theology involved in salvation and the glory and nature of Christ excite the deepest affections. In Robert Peterson&#x2019;s <em>Salvation Accomplished by the Son</em> you will find the most satisfying food for your soul as he navigates the riches of christology and soteriology with deep insight and piercing simplicity.

This book is methodical, thorough, and accessible. It skirts atonement theories and fashionable trends to get at Christ&#x2019;s atoning actions and roles. We learn that the gospel message is not flat and simplistic but multi-dimensional, nuanced, and rich. This book is an extended embodiment of the ancient invitation to &#x2018;behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Robert W. Yarbrough,</strong>&nbsp;Professor of New Testament, Covenant Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;There are many works dealing with Christ&#x2019;s work of redemption, usually focusing on Jesus&#x2019;s dying on the cross to save his people from their sins. While this is an important aspect of Christ&#x2019;s saving work, it is not the complete picture. Dr. Peterson, in examining nine saving events of Christ and six scriptural aspects of his work, presents a more complete picture of Christ&#x2019;s saving work. This study not only presents Christ&#x2019;s work with careful exegesis, but also magnifies the grace and mercy of God as they are seen in Christ&#x2019;s work of salvation. This is a valuable and important contribution to soteriology.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Van Lees</strong>, Pastor, Covenant of Grace Church, St. Charles, Missouri</p></p><h2>Dinner with Jackson Pollock: Recipes, Art &amp; Nature (Connoisseur)</h2><p>Jackson Pollock the artist needs no introduction but perhaps lesser known is Jackson Pollock the gardener, baker, and dinner-party host.

Child, a native of England and former television writer, lives in New York City, where he is at work on his tenth Jack Reacher thriller, The Hard Way.<b>C H A P T E R 2</b><br>Reacher was on his way to them because of a woman. He had spent Friday night in South Beach, Miami, in a salsa club, with a dancer from a cruise ship. The boat was Norwegian, and so was the girl. Reacher guessed she was too tall for ballet, but she was the right size for everything else. They met on the beach in the afternoon. Reacher was working on his tan. He felt better brown. He didn&#x2019;t know what she was working on. But he felt her shadow fall across his face and opened his eyes to find her staring at him. Or maybe at his scars. The browner he got, the more they stood out, white and wicked and obvious. She was pale, in a black bikini. A <i>small </i>black bikini. He pegged her for a dancer long before she told him. It was in the way she held herself. <br><br>They ended up having a late dinner together and then going out to the club. South Beach salsa wouldn&#x2019;t have been Reacher&#x2019;s first choice, but her company made it worthwhile. She was fun to be with. And she was a great dancer, obviously. Full of energy. She wore him out. At four in the morning she took him back to her hotel, eager to wear him out some more. Her hotel was a small Art Deco place near the ocean. Clearly the cruise line treated its people well. Certainly it was a much more romantic destination than Reacher&#x2019;s own motel. And much closer. <br><br>And it had cable television, which Reacher&#x2019;s place didn&#x2019;t. He woke at eight on Saturday morning when he heard the dancer in the shower. He turned on the TV and went looking for ESPN. He wanted Friday night&#x2019;s American League highlights. He never found them. He clicked his way through successive channels and then stopped dead on CNN because he heard the chief of an Indiana police department say a name he knew: <i>James Barr. </i>The picture was of a press conference. Small room, harsh light. Top of the screen was a caption that said: <i>Courtesy NBC. </i>There was a banner across the bottom that said: <i>Friday Night Massacre. </i>The police chief said the name again, <i>James Barr, </i>and then he introduced a homicide detective called Emerson. Emerson looked tired. Emerson said the name for a third time: <i>James Barr. </i>Then, like he anticipated the exact question in Reacher&#x2019;s mind, he ran through a brief biography: <i>Forty-one years old, local Indiana resident, U.S. Army infantry specialist from 1985 to 1991, Gulf War veteran, never married, currently unemployed.<br></i><br>Reacher watched the screen. Emerson seemed like a concise type of a guy. He was brief. No bullshit. He finished his statement and in response to a reporter&#x2019;s question declined to specify what if anything James Barr had said during interrogation. Then he introduced a District Attorney. This guy&#x2019;s name was Rodin, and he wasn&#x2019;t concise. Wasn&#x2019;t brief. He used plenty of bullshit. He spent ten minutes claiming Emerson&#x2019;s credit for himself. Reacher knew how <i>that </i>worked. He had been a cop of sorts for thirteen years. Cops bust their tails, and prosecutors bask in the glory. Rodin said <i>James Barr </i>a few more times and then said the state was maybe looking to fry him.<br><br>For what?<br><br>Reacher waited.<br><br>A local anchor called Ann Yanni came on. She recapped the events of the night before. Sniper slaying. Senseless slaughter. An automatic weapon. A parking garage. A public plaza. Commuters on their way home after a long workweek. Five dead. A suspect in custody, but a city still grieving.<br><br>Reacher thought it was Yanni who was grieving. Emerson&#x2019;s success had cut her story short. She signed off and CNN went to political news. Reacher turned the TV off. The dancer came out of the bathroom. She was pink and fragrant. And naked. She had left her towels inside.<br><br>&#x201c;What shall we do today?&#x201d; she said, with a wide Norwegian smile.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to Indiana,&#x201d; Reacher said.<br>He walked north in the heat to the Miami bus depot. Then he leafed through a greasy timetable and planned a route. It wasn&#x2019;t going to be an easy trip. Miami to Jacksonville would be the first leg. Then Jacksonville to New Orleans. Then New Orleans to St. Louis. Then St. Louis to Indianapolis. Then a local bus, presumably, south into the heartland. Five separate destinations. Arrival and departure times were not well integrated. Beginning to end, it was going to take more than forty-eight hours. He was tempted to fly or rent a car, but he was short of money and he liked buses better and he figured nothing much was going to happen on the weekend anyway.<br><br>What happened on the weekend was that Rosemary Barr called her firm&#x2019;s investigator back. She figured Franklin would have a semiindependent point of view. She got him at home, ten o&#x2019;clock in the morning on the Sunday.<br><br>&#x201c;I think I should hire different lawyers,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Franklin said nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;David Chapman thinks he&#x2019;s guilty,&#x201d; Rosemary said. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t he?<br>So he&#x2019;s already given up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t comment,&#x201d; Franklin said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s one of my employers.&#x201d;<br><br>Now Rosemary Barr said nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;How was the hospital?&#x201d; Franklin asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Awful. He&#x2019;s in intensive care with a bunch of prison deadbeats. They&#x2019;ve got him handcuffed to the bed. He&#x2019;s in a <i>coma, </i>for God&#x2019;s sake. How do they think he&#x2019;s going to escape?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the legal position?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He was arrested but not arraigned. He&#x2019;s in a kind of limbo.<br><br>They&#x2019;re assuming he wouldn&#x2019;t have gotten bail.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re probably right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So they claim under the circumstances it&#x2019;s like he actually <i>didn&#x2019;t </i>get bail. So he&#x2019;s <i>theirs. </i>He&#x2019;s in the system. Like a twilight zone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What would you like to happen?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He shouldn&#x2019;t be in handcuffs. And he should be in a VA hospital at least. But that won&#x2019;t happen until I find a lawyer who&#x2019;s prepared to help him.&#x201d;<br><br>Franklin paused. &#x201c;How do you explain all the evidence?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know my brother.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You moved out, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For other reasons. Not because he&#x2019;s a homicidal maniac.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He blocked off a parking space,&#x201d; Franklin said. &#x201c;He premeditated this thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You think he&#x2019;s guilty, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I work with what I&#x2019;ve got. And what I&#x2019;ve got doesn&#x2019;t look good.&#x201d;<br><br>Rosemary Barr said nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Franklin said.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you recommend another lawyer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can you make that decision?

She just hung out her shingle. She&#x2019;s new and she&#x2019;s keen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is it ethical?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No law against it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It would be father against daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was going to be Chapman, and Chapman knows Rodin a lot better than his daughter does, probably.

It was like a test. Someone new and keen should be at the office on a Sunday.<br><br>Helen Rodin was at the office on a Sunday. She answered the call sitting at her desk. Her desk was secondhand and it sat proudly in a mostly empty two-room suite in the same black glass tower that had NBC as the second-floor tenant. The suite was rented cheap through one of the business subsidies that the city was throwing around like confetti. The idea was to kick-start the rejuvenated downtown area and clean up later with healthy tax revenues.<br><br>Rosemary Barr didn&#x2019;t have to tell Helen Rodin about the case because the whole thing had happened right outside Helen Rodin&#x2019;s new office window. Helen had seen some of it for herself, and she had followed the rest on the news afterward. She had caught all of Ann Yanni&#x2019;s TV appearances. She recognized her from the building&#x2019;s lobby, and the elevator.<br><br>&#x201c;Will you help my brother?&#x201d; Rosemary Barr asked.<br><br>Helen Rodin paused. The smart answer would be <i>No way. </i>She knew that. Li...</p><h2>Proust and Three Dialogues</h2><p>Samuel Beckett&#39;s celebrated early study of Marcel proust, whose theories of time were to play a large part in his own work, was written in 1931. It is a brilliant work of critical insight that also tells us much about its author&#39;s own thinking and preoccupations. In its own right it is a masterpiece of literary and philosophical creative writing. This edition was published in 1999 - ten years after the writer&#39;s death. The volume also contains the equally celebrated dialogues with the art critic Georges Duthuit - written to record their different points of view after the discussions took place. Beckett always let Duthuit win, but his very unusual and often opposite point of view on the nature and purpose of art is all the more forceful and memorable on that account.</p><p>Samuel Beckett (1906-1989) was born in Dublin of a comfortable middle class protestant family. After school in Northern Ireland, he went to Trinity College in Dublin where he distinguished himself in French and Italian and was recognised as a brilliant scholar. Under an exchange agreement, Beckett taught at the Ecole Normale Superieure. He moved to Paris in 1928 to write, staying in France during the Second World War - he was a courier in the Resistance. He was one of the major novelists and playwrights of the last century, as well as a poet and a perceptive writer on the work of others. &#34;Waiting For Godot&#34; brought him world fame but his celebrated fiction includes the &#34;Molloy&#34; trilogy, &#34;Murphy&#34; and &#34;Watt&#34; among others. He has written many plays for stage, T.V., radio and film and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969.</p><h2>The Answer: To Happiness, Health, and Fulfillment in Life : The Holy Bible Translated for Our Time With Selected Writings by Leading Inspirational A</h2><p>Holy Bible translation.</p><p></p><h2>Collected Later Poems</h2><p>Anthony Hecht, now in his eightieth year, has earned a place alongside such poets as W.

Everything is in place, as they say. But being methodical I want something on record to look at when it&#x2019;s all over. You&#x2019;re on your own in this game, so any debriefing is with myself.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing left is to make sure I get the timing right. I&#x2019;m going for 2 a.m. when he&#x2019;ll be sleeping soundly, guaranteed. Get gloved up, let myself in, do the necessary and get out without leaving any trace. The police have no idea and I&#x2019;m not doing them any favours.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#x2019;ll rest in peace and so will I, with the difference that I&#x2019;ll wake up tomorrow morning.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1<br><br></b> I&#x2019;ve seen a few things on the night shift,&#x201d; Police Sergeant Lew Morgan said, &#x201c;but this beats them all.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Shall we stop him?&#x201d; his driver, PC Aaron Green, asked.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;What for? He&#x2019;s not speeding.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;No helmet.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t need one. It&#x2019;s only a trike.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s motorised. He&#x2019;s not turning the pedals.&#x201d; Aaron Green wasn&#x2019;t there simply to drive the car. Typical of young bobbies out to impress, he was constantly on the lookout for offenders.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew was older and reckoned he was wiser. He took stock. There were reflectors on the pedals and, sure enough, they weren&#x2019;t moving, but the tricycle was. Three hours to go and the boredom was getting to him.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Might as well do the business.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>He pressed the control on the dash and triggered the blue flashing lights. &#x201c;Okay, chummy, let&#x2019;s see if your brakes work.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Their patrol car slowed to tail the offending vehicle and draw in behind. The stretch of minor road near Bathampton was otherwise deserted at 2:30 in the morning.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The tricycle came to a controlled stop. Its rider turned his head in a way that involved rotating most of his upper body. He wasn&#x2019;t young.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;You know what?&#x201d; Lew said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a fucking deerstalker he&#x2019;s wearing.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Still illegal,&#x201d; Aaron said.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Who does he think he is?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Fancy dress?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew got out and approached the rider of the tricycle. &#x201c;Switch off, sir.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;I beg your pardon.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Deaf as well.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew shouted, &#x201c;Switch off,&#x201d; and mimed the action with his hand.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The tricyclist obeyed. The hat was definitely a deerstalker. And the rest of the clothes matched. Lew was no fashion expert but he had an idea he was looking at a Norfolk jacket worn over a check shirt and trousers kept in place by leather gaiters. Like some character out of a television costume drama.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>And the voice was vintage BBC. &#x201c;How can I be of assistance, officer?&#x201d; How patronising was that?<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Do you have a licence to ride this thing?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;I do not.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew almost rubbed his hands. He was going to enjoy this. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re aware that it&#x2019;s a form of motorcycle?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;I suppose it might be described as such.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;So you need a licence.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Actually, no.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;What do you mean, no? You just agreed with me it&#x2019;s a motorcycle.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;In the eyes of the law, it&#x2019;s a beast of another colour, so to speak.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;A <i>what</i>?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;In point of fact this is an EAPC.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew was supposed to be the voice of authority here. He wasn&#x2019;t about to show frailty by asking what an EAPC was. &#x201c;That may be so but it&#x2019;s motor-powered. You were riding without moving your legs.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The man gave the sort of smile that gets the seat by the window. &#x201c;Only because the poor old pins aren&#x2019;t up to pedalling so far these days.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew didn&#x2019;t have any sympathy for the elderly. They did far too well out of the state with their inflation-proof pensions and all the extras. &#x201c;So it&#x2019;s a motorbike. You&#x2019;re not wearing a helmet either.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;That is true, officer.&#x201d; Far from sounding apologetic, this lawbreaker was oozing confidence.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew remained civil, but firm. &#x201c;Did you know it&#x2019;s also against the law to ride a motorcycle without a helmet?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Now the silver eyebrows peaked in concern. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re worried about my safety?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not worried. I&#x2019;m not worried in the least. I&#x2019;m telling you it&#x2019;s illegal.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh dear.&#x201d; But the concern wasn&#x2019;t for himself, it was for Lew. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose you come across many drivers of motorised tricycles.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s beside the point, sir.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Forgive me, officer. I&#x2019;m trying to save you some embarrassment.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Trying to save <i>me</i>?&#x201d; Lew said.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;You see I wouldn&#x2019;t be out on the public highway if I knew I was in breach of the law. However, if you&#x2019;ll bear with me a moment . . .&#x201d; He dipped his right hand towards his jacket pocket.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew reacted fast. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that!&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The startled old man almost fell off the saddle.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Put your hands where I can see them, on the handlebars. What&#x2019;s in the pocket?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Only a piece of paper. I always carry a copy of the official government advice, which I believe is still in force. I was about to invite you to look at it.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need to.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a shame, because if you did you would see that provided I don&#x2019;t exceed fifteen miles an hour and my vehicle doesn&#x2019;t weigh more than sixty kilograms and the power is not more than two hundred and fifty watts, my choice of transport&#x2014;contrary to appearance&#x2014;is not classed as a motorcycle but an electrically assisted pedal cycle.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>An EAPC.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>All this had been spoken with such self-assurance that<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew knew with a sinking heart it had to be right. The figures the old jerk had quoted were faintly familiar. Out on patrol you don&#x2019;t often come across motorised trikes. This road user was a pain in the arse, but he was in the clear. He didn&#x2019;t require a licence or a helmet. Lew should have stuck to his first impulse and told young Aaron to drive straight past. Now it was a matter of saving face. He pointed to the large bag strapped to the back of the saddle.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s in that?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Nothing of interest to the police, I promise you.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Answer the question, please.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;A plastic box containing a banana and a slice of date and walnut cake. I come prepared, in case I get hungry.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Is that all?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t finished. A flask of tea. Also my binoculars, camera, tripod, an ordnance survey map.&#x201d; He smiled. &#x201c;And Trixie.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;You mean, &#x2018;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x2019; Trixie is my late wife.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>There was a pause for thought. &#x201c;In this bag?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;I always bring her ashes with me. We shared so much in life. She passed away six months ago. Examine her, by all means. And I forgot the puncture repair kit. It&#x2019;s surprising how much the bag holds.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Best insist on the old man handling his own possessions. The power to search at a road check has to involve suspicion of a serious arrestable offence. Lew asked him to unzip the saddlebag. This involved a contortion that was clearly uncomfortable, but Lew wasn&#x2019;t going to get caught out a second time.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The vacuum flask and the sandwich box containing a banana and a wedge of cake were visible on top. And so was the lid of a plastic urn. Lew didn&#x2019;t need to meet Trixie close up.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;What are the binoculars for?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re thinking I might be a peeping Tom. Absolutely not. I&#x2019;m well past that sort of nonsense.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Most people are in bed at this time of night,&#x201d; Lew said.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not compulsory. We&#x2019;re living in a free country.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Do you mind telling me where you&#x2019;re going?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A reasonable question that got an unhelpful answer. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t know until I get there, will I?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew was being led into a minefield of embarrassment. He knew it. The only mercy was that Aaron was out of earshot.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The old man added, &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t stay in one spot. They&#x2019;re moving steadily closer to Bath, you see.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>He didn&#x2019;t see. He didn&#x2019;t see at all. But he wasn&#x2019;t so stupid as to ask. He waited for something more, and he got it. <br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;They can cover as much as a mile in a single night, using hops.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;A mile a night?&#x201d; Lew pictured a colony of travelling rabbits. What was that film he&#x2019;d once seen about rabbits on the move? <i>Watership Down</i>. &#x201c;And you hope to see them through your binoculars?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Unless I can get really close and observe them with the naked eye. It depends on the terrain.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;If they&#x2019;re always moving, how do you know where to look?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;I would have thought that was obvious.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Not to me, sir.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;You can hear them some way off.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Hear them doing what?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Digging their holes.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>This was the moment Lew decided to quit. &#x201c;On this occasion I&#x2019;m going to leave you to it. For your own safety, I advise you to get a cycle helmet. And keep off the A roads.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m obliged to you, but I always do.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Go carefully. Other traffic may not see you coming.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The old man looked skywards. &#x201c;A full moon helps.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>You bet it does, you old loony, Lew thought, as he returned to the patrol car. He opened the door, got in and watched in silence as the tricyclist moved off.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Watership Down was a real place somewhere in Hampshire, seventy miles down the M4.

He<br> turned the car and headed back towards the lights of Bath.<br> No more was said for some time.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Eventually Aaron asked, &#x201c;Did the old bloke say what he<br> was up to?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Stalking rabbits.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;To shoot?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;To watch.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Like a safari?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew didn&#x2019;t smile.

Some people with a ladder had been seen acting suspiciously near a church north of the city in Julian Road. In the last six months the lead had been stripped from several roofs in Bath. The thieves could make as much as twenty grand from one night&#x2019;s work.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Two patrols were ordered to the scene.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The burst of activity using blues and twos brought muchneeded distraction. Aaron jammed his foot down and they arrived first, just as two chancers from Swindon were loading their loot into the back of a pick-up truck.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Gotcha.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The arrest filled an hour profitably and made a success of what had promised to be a long, barren night. The other patrol didn&#x2019;t show up, but Lew and Aaron didn&#x2019;t mind. By the time they had delivered their prisoners to the custody centre in Keynsham and gone through the formalities with the sergeant their shift was almost over.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>It wasn&#x2019;t worth going out on the roads again. Their relief would be coming in at 7 a.m.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Cue for a coffee.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Every officer working a shift knows the final hour is the worst possible time to get involved in a fresh incident because it has to be followed through regardless of when you&#x2019;re supposed to go off duty. So Lew and Aaron weren&#x2019;t overjoyed when ordered at 6:19 to investigate a report of a naked man in Beckford Gardens.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all I want, another nutcase,&#x201d; Lew said.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>They returned to the car.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;What are we dealing with here&#x2014;a drunk?&#x201d; he asked the control room as the early morning traffic moved aside for their flashing lights. &#x201c;Is he dancing in the street and singing &#x2018;I want to break free&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The operator giggled. &#x201c;You tell me when you get there.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</i></p><h2>VISION &amp; RELATED WRITING</h2><p>Contents: a packet for Ezra Pound; stories of Michael Robartes and his friends: an extract from a record made by his pupils; phases of moon; great wheel; completed symbol; soul in judgment; great year of ancients; dove or swan; all soul&#39;s night, an epilogue.

There are more than 10,000 varieties of wildflowers in North America, some rare, some so plentiful that they are designated as invasive weeds. Each has a unique story.<br>There's Bouncing Bet, a perennial common along the roads and railroad tracks of America. Like many of our most abundant summer wildflowers, Bet was brought over to fill colonial gardens. It's a beautiful plant, but also a useful one. Open up the stalk and its sap makes a fine soap. Colonial beermakers used to put a dab in to help the head on a brew. Doctors used it to wash wounds. Generally considered a weed, it's everywhere.<br>Or Coltsfoot, which pops up almost alone in winters, and was used in New England as a cure for coughs, the leaves boiled down in water. Asthmatics, Sanders tells us, used to smoke it for relief. For many years, apothecaries in France used Coltsfoot as its symbol, a surprising pedigree for a neglected "weed."<br>More a companion than a field guide, THE SECRETS OF WILDFLOWERS is a must-have for anyone who enjoys a walk in a meadow or a gaze outside.<br><br></p><p>Without wildflowers the world would be a pretty dull place.<br>Few things in nature beautify the world more than wildflowers.

Dever attacks the minimalist position head-on, showing how modern archaeology brilliantly illuminates both life in ancient Palestine and the sacred scriptures as we have them today. Assembling a wealth of archaeological evidence, Dever builds the clearest, most, complete case yet for the existence of a real Israel during the Iron Age of ancient Palestine (1200-600 B.C.).</p><p>For centuries the Hebrew Bible has been the fountainhead of the Judeo-Christian tradition. Today, however, the entire biblical tradition, including its historical veracity, is being challenged. Leading this assault is a group of scholars described as the "minimalist" or "revisionist" school of biblical studies, which charges that the Hebrew Bible is largely pious fiction, that its writers and editors invented "ancient Israel" as a piece of late Jewish propaganda in the Hellenistic era.<p>In this fascinating book noted Syro-Palestinian archaeologist William G. Dever attacks the minimalist position head-on, showing how modern archaeology brilliantly illuminates both life in ancient Palestine and the sacred scriptures as we have them today. Assembling a wealth of archaeological evidence, Dever builds the clearest, most complete yet of the "real Israel that existed during the Iron Age of ancient Palestine (1200-600 B.C.).</p><p>Dever's exceptional reconstruction of this key period points up the minimalists' abuse of archaeology and reveals the weakness of their revisionist histories. Dever shows that ancient Israel, far from being an "invention, " is a reality to be "discovered.

Paul Getty</h2><p>When J. Paul Getty died in 1976, he left a fortune of four billion dollars to be divided among nineteen heirs, and the author of The Private Lives of Winston Churchill examines the sometimes disastrous effects of this money on its recipients.</p><p>"The name Getty has become a 'synonym for family disfunction,' " notes Pearson in his introduction to this cautionary tale of how too much money can destroy lives. Pearson, historian and biographer of Winston Churchill and the British royal family, needed to add no flourish to this fascinating family saga. A robber baron's son and businessman extraordinaire, Jean Paul Getty helped build this country's financial infrastructure with oil and greed. His obsessions built a dynasty that, at the time of his death in 1976, included five ex-wives, four sons, over a dozen grandchildren, multiple mistresses, and a fortune in excess of $4 billion. From court battles to suicide to AIDs, the Getty family has been cursed with psychoses, traumas, and maladies of operatic proportions. The most harrowing is the account of the kidnapping of Getty's grandson in Europe. Getty, ever cantankerous and miserly, refused to pay a cent of ransom money, and young Paul's severed ear was mailed to him as a bargaining chip. Amid seemingly endless public curiosity about the trials and tribulations of the rich and famous, this is a good choice for popular biography collections.?David Nudo, "Library Journal"<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The President&#39;s Daughter</h2><p>The president of the United States enlists the aid of ex-IRA enforcer-turned-security expert Sean Dillon and Blake Johnson, head of an elite, secret White House group, to find his kidnapped daughter, the result of a twenty-year-old affair with a lovely Frenchwoman.

The characters are strictly Central Casting: a gallant war-hero president twitted by terrorists, a craggy old pro called out of retirement, an I.R.A. scoundrel with a heart of ... well, brass at least. The daughter of the title is a comely French countess (of course), who's kidnapped by a nefarious group of Israeli extremists. In return for her safety, they want Dad to nuke several Arab countries. Will he be forced to push the button, or will a trio of agents be able to reach her in time? Typical of the genre, the book's pull is the intelligence of the villains multiplied by the ingenuity of the heroes. <i>The President's Daughter</i> scores highly on both and readers itching for a globe-trotting game of cat-and-rat won't be disappointed.Jack Higgins lives on Jersey in the Channel Islands.</p><h2>My world of fairy tales: Stories from Grimm, Perrault, and Andersen</h2><p>Twenty-three fairy tales selected from the work of Perrault, Grimm, and Andersen.</p><p></p><h2>Bad Kitty vs Uncle Murray: The Uproar at the Front Door</h2><p><p>Kitty's owners are taking a week off and leaving Kitty and Puppy at home.

It is a celebration of the female nude; featuring female couples in images that have been selected to highlight the erotic charge when two women are photographed together, between the women themselves, between models and photographer, and between the photograph and the viewer. Erotic photography is now at the forefront of fashion, and Femmes focuses on one of the most exciting and perennially popular subjects, bringing together a collection of the most significant work in this field. This photographic celebration is wonderfully illustrated with 190 outstanding color, duotone, and black-and-white photographs, including those by Michael Childers, Bob Carlos Clarke, Wolfgang Eichler, Nan Goldin, James &amp; James, Pierre et Gilles, Housk Randall, Wolfgang Tillmans, and Trevor Watson.</p><p>Michelle Olley is editor of P.U.R.E., a sophisticated fashion and arts magazine with a sexy edge. She is the author of three collections of photography, Homme, Venus and Love Lust Desire (Carlton Books). Michelle was previously editor of Attitude, the UK&#39;s leading gay men&#39;s lifestyle magazine. For over ten years she has been actively involved, as director and features editor, with Skin Two magazine, the world&#39;s best-known fetish lifestyle title. Michelle was also responsible for instigating the Skin Two Rubber Ball, now the largest fetish party in the world.A visual feast of the erotic, this impressively produced volume contains 190 photographs (in colour, duotone and black and white) along with appropriate text that (thankfully) resists any heavy breathing. One person&#39;s eroticism is another person&#39;s pornography, the saying goes, but only the most illiberal are likely to be upset by the sumptuous offerings here. The photographers range from the workaday to the truly inspired, but nearly all are suffused with a heady erotic charge that (in certain cases) virtually leaps off the page. This could make a very tempting present for any sensualists of your acquaintance, particularly if they are aficionados of lingerie, black leather and elegant Sapphic couplings.</p><h2>Motorcycle: The Definitive Visual History</h2><p>Tracing the history of two-wheeled grit and glory, from the first prototypes to the superbikes of today, Motorcycle: The Definitive Visual History covers more than 1,000 of the world&#39;s greatest machines, from the earliest prototypes from the mid-nineteenth century, to the dynamic speedsters of today.

Here, in the sometimes too close embrace of the local Southern Sudanese Community, she dreams of South Sudan while she tries to navigate the strange world of America - a world where a girl can wear a short skirt, get a tattoo or even date a boy; a world that puts her into sharp conflict with her traditional mother who, like Viola, is struggling to braid together the strands of a displaced life. Terry Farish&#39;s haunting novel is not only a riveting story of escape and survival, but the universal tale of a young immigrant&#39;s struggle to build a life on the cusp of two cultures.</p><p>As a child I had many secret loves and one was a book I tried to hide behind the stacks at my town library so it would always be there for me. As an adult, one of my greatest loves is also a book, <em>The Old Man and the Sea</em>. I remember when I first read it, in one lit corner of my house, my child asleep, reading for the first time Hemingway's simple acts of human grace in that story. I also really like multicultural literature (see my blog at The Elephant Rag). One of my favorite stories I mention in The Elephant Rag is from Jamaica which offers a slang phrase for telling stories - "pop tory a me ears." I continue to make discoveries under a single light in a quiet house. I share many of these stories in the literacy program I coordinate for the NH Humanities Council, <em>Connections</em>. <p>In 2012 my novel <em>The Good Braider</em> will be published. The <em>Good Braider</em> is a young adult novel in verse about a young girl's fight to survive the violence of war in Juba, Sudan and then conflict within her own family when they resettle in Portland, Maine and she is both Sudanese and American.</p>&#x201c;In <em>The Good Braider</em>, Terry Farish creates a masterful triumph of character and story. Her Viola &#x2013; strong, frank, tenderly wistful, and brave &#x2013; is so expressive and endearing, that you will never again encounter a refugee from anywhere without remembering Viola and her family. This is a book of deep understanding and unforgettable empathy.&#x201d; &#x2013; NAOMI SHIHAB NYE, author of <em>There Is No Long Distance</em> <br><br>&#x201c;Terry Farish seems to breathe the reader into the emotional spaces of war, exile, and refugee life. Teenaged Viola&#x2019;s flight with her family from Sudan spirals into a search for hope in the face of irredeemable loss. <em>The Good Braider</em> is a delicate, stunning exploration of its young protagonist&#x2019;s life and heart.&#x201d; -- UMA KRISHNASWAMI, author of <em>The Grand Plan to Fix Everything</em> <br><br>The eloquent voice of teenager Viola, a Bari girl from Sudan, is captured perfectly in this free verse novel. Viola is forced to flee from her country with her mother and baby brother to escape the brutal civil war taking place there. They travel first to Cairo, to a refugee camp, before eventually arriving in Portland, Maine in the United States. Viola has endured rape, has witnessed the vicious shooting of a boy who was trying to save her, has experienced the death of her little brother and the loss of her grandmother, but nothing prepares her for the reaction of her mother when Viola makes friends with an American boy. Like all teenagers, Viola wants to fit in and be like her new friends, but her mother wants to maintain the traditional ways. Reminiscent of <em>Shabanu, Daughter of the Wind</em> by Suzanne Fisher Staples, the fully realized characters and the story are completely captivating. While Viola's story is painful, readers will relate to her and sympathize with her struggle to go to school and work to help provide income for her family while trying to make a new life for herself in a country where the customs are so different from the customs of her people in Sudan. The book includes notes about the current political situation in Sudan and a brief history of the circumstances of the civil war. Very highly recommended. <em>--Ellen Welty, Children's Literature</em><br></p><h2>A Simple Twist Of Fate: Bob Dylan and The Making of Blood on The Tracks</h2><p>In 1974 Bob Dylan wrote, recorded, reconsidered, and then re-recorded Blood on the Tracks, and to this day, no one who hears it can avoid being blown away by its emotional power. Commonly referred to as &#34;the greatest break-up album of all time,&#34; it was written as Dylan&#39;s own twelve-year marriage began to painfully unravel. Songs like &#34;Tangled Up in Blue,&#34; &#34;Idiot Wind,&#34; and &#34;Shelter from the Storm&#34; have become the template for multidimensional, adult songs of love, longing, and loss.Yet the full story behind the creation of this album has never been told. The authors have drawn upon first-hand information and interviews with the musicians, producers, industry insiders, as well as Dylan&#39;s friends, associates, and relatives. A Simple Twist of Fate is an engaging chronicle of how one artist transformed his personal pain and confusion into great art.</p><p><b>Andy Gill</b> is a leading critic for The Independent, and has edited or written for NME, Q, Mojo, Rolling Stone, GQ, and Maxim. He lives in London. <b>Kevin Odegard</b> was a brakeman on the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad when he was asked to play guitar on Blood on the Tracks. He has written for USA Today, Billboard, and other periodicals. He lives in Wayzata, Minnesota.This is a solid look at the background to the making of Blood on the Tracks, considered one of Bob Dylan's greatest recordings since its release 30 years ago. Gill is a skilled British music journalist, as is Odegard, who was one of the Minneapolis session musicians Dylan used to redo five songs recorded three months earlier in New York City. The authors look at the album they believe "set a new benchmark in confessional songwriting" by looking at it from every possible angle: Dylan's musical decision to return to folk after his electric and country periods; the disintegration of his marriage to his first wife, Sara, in the wake of Dylan's various affairs; his strained relationship with his younger brother, David, who helped remake the album in Minneapolis. While the authors do give a truly complete sense of the background that produced the album, much of this has been covered in far more detail in such books as Clinton Heylin's Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited (which the authors cite) and will be familiar to all Dylan fans. Fortunately, the authors shine throughout the rest of the book, which presents an enormous amount of previously unreported detail about the making of the album&#x2014;down to the kind of microphones that were used. Their descriptions of the energy and enthusiasm of these musicians will make even the most hardcore Dylan fan hear Blood on the Tracks anew. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Equally significant are his teachings. During his career, thousands of students have passed through his studio. Finally, there is the definitive book on his career. Arnold Jacobs: Song and Wind is written by Mr. Jacobs' assistant, Brian Frederiksen, and edited by John Taylor. With a length of 296 pages, material comes from masterclasses, private interviews, previously published writings and contributions from his students and colleagues.<br><br>Subjects include:<br>The Performer:<br>Early Years, Curtis Institute, Indianapolis Symphony, Pittsburgh Symphony, Chicago Symphony, Conductors, Other Performances, York Tuba<br>The Teacher:<br>Physical Elements, Mental Elements, Performance, Instruments, The Jacobs Studio<br>Discography, Full Documentation<br>And more . . .<br><br>Song and Wind<br>Excerpted from Arnold Jacobs: Song and Wind*<br>By Brian Frederiksen<br>One of Jacobs' most famous phrases is Song and Wind. During his lecture at the 1995 International Brassfest in Bloomington, Indiana, he explained:<br><br>"My approach to music is expressed as Song and Wind. This is very important to communicate a musical message to the audience.<br><br>"This approach is one of simplicity as the structure and function of the human being is very complex, but we function in a simple manner. When we bring it to the art form it becomes very simple.<br><br>"Song, to me, involves about 85 percent of the intellectual concentration of playing an instrument, based on what you want the audience to hear.<br><br>"You cannot get anywhere without wind. If you think of a car, the wheels will not turn without an energy source--the engine. Brass players must have a source of energy as there must be a vibrating column of air for the instrument to amplify and resonate. The musical engine is the vibration of the lips. However, the lips cannot vibrate without wind.<br><br>"When we combine Song and Wind, the musical message, song, is the principal element comprising 85 percent of the consciousness. The remaining 15 percent is the application of the breath, wind, to fuel the vibration of the lips."<br><br>Adolph Herseth puts it another way, "You have to start with a very precise sense of how something should sound. Then, instinctively, you modify your lip and your breathing and the pressure of the horn to obtain that sound."<br><br>Wind is the energy source used to fuel the conceptual message of the song from the brain. His emphasis of Song and Wind shows how much importance Jacobs gives to musical conception. "Study the product, not the method. Mentalize music by making statements, not by asking questions."</p><p>Brian Frederiksen was born into a family of flute players as his mother and aunt were the flute section of the Albany (NY) Symphony. Eventually, he began playing the tuba when eleven years old. He he graduated from the Interlochen Arts Academy, the American Conservatory in Chicago (BM), and Northwestern University (MM). <br><br>During his studies in Chicago beginning in 1973, he started a long relationship with Arnold Jacobs. Besides being the legendary tubist of the Chicago Symphony (1944-1988), Jacobs was the teacher recognized as the expert on breathing for wind instruments. <br><br>During twenty-five years with Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Frederiksen was a student and then his assistant with masterclasses, first at Northwestern University and then throughout the country. He wrote Arnold Jacobs: Song and Wind, and formed WindSong Press Ltd. carrying books, CDs, music and breathing devices. After Mr. Jacobs passed away, he worked with the Jacobs family to preserve the Jacobs legacy for future research by creating the Arnold and Gizella Jacobs Collection. windsongpress.com was created as the web s most complete source about Arnold Jacobs. <br><br>Mr. Frederiksen brought Mr Jacobs masterclasses back through Arnold Jacobs Almost Live, a series of ten presentations featuring videos from Mr Jacobs classes creating a new generation of Jacobs students. Arnold Jacobs Almost Live has been featured at a number of conferences including the National Flute Association, Austrailia s Melbourne International Festival of Brass, regional and international conferences of the International Tuba Euphonium Association and various universities including three day continuing education classes.Mark Nelson - TUBA Journal, Winter, 1997<br>Printed in its entirety with permission of Mark Nelson.<br>Arnold Jacobs is one of the true legendary teachers and performers of all time. That he also plays the tuba makes that fact all more the sweet. Brian Frederiksen spent several years gathering material from Jacobs' masterclasses, previously published writings and contributions from his students and colleagues as well as interviewing Jacobs, himself, to write this definitive book on the master's career from the earliest days as a boy in the Los Angeles area through his appearance at the 1995 Tuba/Euphonium Conference at Northwestern University. John Taylor has done a masterful job putting the copious amount of material into readable form and Frederiksen also has generously devoted five entire pages to personnel who helped provide information and source material for this book.<br><br>In addition to a detailed and exhaustive biography, this book also contains a plethora of material not only exhaustively detailing virtually every aspect of Jacobs' teaching but also a seemingly inexhaustible supply of information associated with him. Information such as a list of every brass player who ever played in the Chicago Symphony and a listing of every recording Arnold Jacobs made either with a symphony or as a soloist or chamber musician help put his astonishing career into perspective. An entire chapter is devoted to York tubas, another to Jacobs' studio through the years, and another to biographies of all the conductors of the Chicago Symphony including major guest conductors. There is even a sub-chapter on every renovation Chicago's Orchestra Hall received during Jacobs' tenure. The lists and detailed information go on and on. Frederiksen has not only managed to capture the essence of one of the greatest musicians to influence generations of brass performers, but he also provided a truly meaningful historical perspective and backdrop to Jacobs' career.<br><br>Another facet of this book that is most gratifying to this reviewer is the careful research and documentation of the information Frederiksen was able to collect. The author providing over 20 pages of end notes, each referenced with the exact primary source consulted. The bibliography alone is eight pages long. A name and a subject index are included for easy reference to a particular person or topic in the book.<br><br>Other appealing aspects of this book include a very generous allocation of space for pictures of Jacobs, his wife, his colleagues and friends, tubas, teaching equipment, as well as many medical illustrations to help visualize his teaching. Graphs, charts, and diagrams are also used to illustrate points Jacobs makes about particular facets of his teaching.<br><br>What can this book do for the student and brass teacher? The chapters on Jacobs' teaching philosophy and the physical and mental elements of performance are a blend of the best available information on his teaching. Most of us who have ever taken a private lesson have been influenced to some degree by Arnold Jacobs. In this book, however, all the pieces are put into place in a fashion not available anywhere else. If there is perhaps one aspect of this book that is not stellar to this reader, it is that sometimes the information is so detailed, not only in the teaching chapters but throughout the book, that it is very easy to lose sight of the point of discussion. I found myself rereading chapters several times to gain new insight into the man and teacher. As a tribute to one of our most respected colleagues, it represents a synthesis of the best we all aspire to. I know I will be reading out of this book for the rest of my life for myself and for my students. --TUBA Journal<br><br>Douglas Hill<br>Excerpts from Journal of the International Horn Society, February 1997<br>This book is full of anecdotal praise --International Trumpet Guild Journal,<br><br>Douglas Hill<br>Excerpts from Journal of the International Horn Society, February 1997<br>This book is full of anecdotal praise for all of the accomplishments and the vast influences rendered by Mr. Jacobs, perhaps to an extreme. One does not need to overly justify the importance of such a book as this.<br><br>It is the extensive and useful materials within the chapters titled: Teacher, Physical Elements, Mental Elements, Performance, and part of the chapter on Instruments that I wish to recommend for all horn players and teachers. Through a thorough study of these nearly eighty pages of brilliant, insightful, helpful, and well-written lessons, we all can learn new ways to do what we need to do both physiologically and philosophically as performers, or at least new ways to say it as teachers. This book compiles the most important philosophical principles, basic tenets, and quotes of Arnold Jacobs. That fact alone should explain why these chapters should be required reading. --International Horn Society<br><br>Robert Henley Woody II<br>Excerpts from International Trumpet Guild Journal, May 1998<br><br>Arnold Jacobs: Song and Wind by Brian Frederiksen, is clearly a labor of love. In 1974, the author began studying with Arnold Jacobs, and the result was a lifetime of devotion to his mentor. The frailty of the octogenarian master led the student to take on the task of chronicling Jacobs' personal and professional evolution.<br><br>Overall, the substance of the book reflects a studious yet personalized analysis of an extensive compilation of information. Included are quotes from Jacobs, a discography, and a listing of brass personnel in various ensembles with which Jacobs was associated. Other researchers will benefit from the extensive references.<br><br>Structurally, the book proceeds in chronological fashion, describing Jacobs' early development, years at the Curtis Institute, performing stints with various ensembles, and retirement. Also included are brief essays on others, such as conductors. The latter half of the book delves into Jacobs' views on teaching, the physical and mental aspects of performance, instruments, and the favored York tuba. Descriptions of his studios and the various devices (e.g., breath builder, incentive spirometer, oscilloscope) that he used for teaching and developing performance ability add to the detail of the text.<br><br>One positive aspect of the book is that it is unquestionably authoritative. The author provides countless details that allow the reader to acquire considerable knowledge about Arnold Jacobs. The countless details may, however, also be seen as a negative. The minutiae about other people and situations sometimes have doubtful usefulness, even to historians. There is also some problem with transition and continuity, resulting in a somewhat choppy flow. The material is otherwise well edited.<br><br>Arnold Jacobs leaves a valuable musical legacy. Despite its shortcomings, Arnold Jacobs: Song and Wind is an important source for all musicians, particularly those who play brass instruments. --International Trumpet Guild Journal,</p><h2>French Feasts: 299 Traditional Recipes for Family Meals and Gatherings</h2><p>In France, where eating is a national pastime, the long, leisurely Sunday lunch is a feast for the senses. It is this quality that acclaimed chef and author St�phane Reynaud captures so perfectly in his paean to traditional French cooking. Rustic and approachable, humorous and convivial, <i>French Feasts</i> features 299 recipes for beloved dishes like pat�s, gratins, savory tarts, and braised meats that are the essence of French weekend fare.From classic stews like navarin and boeuf bourguignon, to foie gras prepared six different ways, to cr�me brul�e and g�teau Basque, the recipes come from all over France and even some former colonies (couscous is a national favorite). The book also includes beautiful, earthy photographs, whimsical illustrations, profiles of local producers, and fact-filled sidebars&#x2015;a guide to cognac and Armagnac, how to make the perfect croissant, and much more&#x2015;that evoke the considerable pleasures of the French table.</p><p>St�phane Reynaud is the owner of Villa 9 Trois in Montreuil, near Paris, a highly regarded restaurant specializing in pork. The grandson of a village butcher on the Ard�che plateau in France, Reynaud is the author of <i>Pork &amp; Sons</i> and <i>Terrine</i>.*Starred Review* It might be presumptuous to say that anything could be a one-stop resource on rustic French cooking, but Reynaud&#x2019;s door-stopper cookbook comes pretty close. Don&#x2019;t mistake this for a beginner&#x2019;s course, though. Though uncomplicated, Reynaud&#x2019;s recipes assume some culinary expertise and are refreshingly free of hand-holding, which allows cooks with a decent grasp of technique to gather a more wide-angled picture of what they&#x2019;re actually doing to food, rather than a detailed map of how to arrive at a finished dish. Most of the creations get their own full-page, artistically composed photograph that proves that there&#x2019;s a passionate relationship between the eyes and the stomach. Reynaud clearly possesses a comprehensive knowledge of French cuisine, and in this book he takes special pleasure in bringing together all aspects of French country life, offering brief bios of local artisans, sheet music for traditional songs, and glib cartoons detailing everything from the different cuts on a cow and the proper method for rolling croissants to the various pleasures fit to be accompanied by Champagne. Much more than just a collection of recipes, this hearty homage to culinary artistry is itself a work of art worthy of being savored, slowly and thoroughly or one bite at a time. --Ian Chipman</p><h2>The Lawless (The Kent Family Chronicles)</h2><p>The Kent Family Chronicles continue as Jeremiah Kent becomes an infamous shootist in the Wild West-bringing him closer to a destiny that will end in bloodshed.</p><p>15 1.5-hour cassettesJohn Jakes is the bestselling author of <i>Charleston</i>, the <i>Kent Family Chronicles</i>, the <i>North and South</i> trilogy, <i>On Secret Service</i>, <i>California Gold</i>, <i>Homeland</i>, and <i>American Dreams</i>.

Among the first to value and collect such work was the French artist Jean Dubuffet (1901-85). For those he judged to represent the 'purest form of creation' he coined the term Art Brut, literally 'raw art' - raw because it was 'uncooked' by culture, raw because it came directly from the psyche, art touched by a raw nerve.<br>In Raw Creation John Maizels traces the history of the recognition and study of this art and examines the different theories and definitions that have grown up around it. He provides detailed expositions of the work of individual artists ranging from such Art Brut masters as Adolf Wolfli and Aloise Corbaz to such gifted American folk artists as Bill Traylor and Mose Tolliver. Devoting several chapters to large-scale visionary environments, he takes a broad international view embracing Rodia's towers in Watts, Los Angeles, the Palais Ideal in the south of France, and Nek Chand's sculpture garden in north India.</p><p>Primitive, folk, naive, self-taught, outsider--branding art made outside of the conventional art world has become a tender task. What defines it? Who are its creators? No matter what you call it, there&#39;s no denying the visceral appeal of raw creativity unbound by rules, class, or education. Long-overdue attention is finally being awarded to self-taught artists--so often marginalized by race, economics, and social structure--allowing them to carve a solid place for themselves and their work in the world of high art. Maizel&#39;s book examines the history, study, and appreciation of this century&#39;s self-taught art, from the maniacal drawings of asylum inmates to found-object sculptures made by street people to homes surrounded by monoliths or covered in mosaic. The book bills itself as an introduction to the topic, but it is in fact quite a comprehensive study. It is divided into three sections: part one explores early studies of the work of the insane, Dubuffet and Art Brut; part two chronicles folk art and self-taught artists around the world; and part three delves into the world of visionary environments. The contemporary busyness of the design-small type, footnotes printed perpendicular to text, and seemingly random increases in font size can be frustrating, but plow through--the content is informative and inspirational.John Maizels, a widely respected authority on &#39;Outsider&#39; and self-taught art, is Editor of Raw Vision magazine.

In these exquisite tales, an explorer goes mad when faced with the disappearance of a river; blue herons descend upon Manhattan; a lonely desert hermit clears a path for a secret celestial wind; and more.</p><p>If science seeks to demystify life, literature can restore a needed measure of wonder to it. Or, as one of the characters in Barry Lopez's collection of short stories <i>Winter Count</i> puts it, "If you are careful, I think there is probably nothing that cannot be retrieved."<p> Much indeed is retrieved in Lopez's pages, first published in 1981: lost species, lost memories, lost emotions. In one especially Borgesian story, a university professor seeks to puzzle out the facts behind 19th-century reports of a herd of white buffalo that, singing, pointed a way into heaven. In another, a young man catches a glimpse into the workings of the stars and planets in an unlikely corner of the Arizona desert. In still another, a traveler recapitulates the pain of lost love while contemplating the graceful flight of herons. </p><p> Lopez's marvelous stories are about many things. Underlying them is a shared precision of language and vision, a precision that characterizes the author's works of nonfiction (<i>Of Wolves and Men</i>, <i>Arctic Dreams</i>). Behind Lopez's stories as well is a quiet insistence on the centrality of nature--an awareness of which, he suggests, can make the busiest city livable, and the deepest wounds of the heart bearable. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>"Perfectly crafted. . . . [These] stories expand of their own accord, lingering in the mind the way intense light lingers in the retina." --"Los Angeles Times <br>"Animals and landscapes have not had this weight, this precision, in American fiction since Hemingway's young heroes were fishing the streams of upper Michigan and Spain." --"San Francisco Chronicle <p>Aflock of great blue herons descending through a snowstorm to the streets of New York. . . . A river in Nebraska disappearing mysteri-ously. . . . A ghostly herd of buffalo that sings a song of death. . . . A mystic who raises constellations of stones from the desert floor. . . . All these are to be found in Winter Count, the exquisite and rapturous collection by the National Book Award-winning author of Arctic Dreams. </p><p>In these resonant and unpredictable stories Barry Lopez proves that he is one of the most important and original writers at work in America today. With breathtaking skill and a few deft strokes he produces painfully beautiful scenes. Combining the real with the wondrous, he offers us a pure vision of people alive to the immediacy and spiritual truth of nature. <br>"Powerful. . . .

There it is, plain and simple.� -- Seymour Shubin, Edgar Award finalist, author of <i>Anyone's My Name</i><br><br> This superbly crafted horror story explores the dichotomy between belief and rationality. Why has a small town maintained a contract since the eighteenth century with a member of the community and his heirs to pull weeds in Lorne Field? Jack Durkin, the current and ninth generation of Lorne Field caretakers, says the things he pulls from the ground aren�t weeds; they are something called Aukowies, and if they�re not pulled up by the roots and burned every day, the world will end. Under pressure from his wife to get a real job; from the town fathers (looking to save a few bucks and end the contract); and from his sons, who don�t see themselves as career weed- pullers, Durkin is finally out of a job.

A few deaths at conveniently inopportune moments and several coincidental fades to black only add to the dramatic tension of the narrative. Stories of this kind are hard to pull off and often collapse under the weight of their outrageous premises long before they end.

Erhard also became the focus of renewed charges that his est movement had taken on some of the trappings of a cult. At the same time, the Internal Revenue Service persisted in claims that Erhard's est-related companies owed millions of dollars in back taxes. A bitter divorce battle between Erhard and his second wife further helped to fuel speculation that est's approach to personal transformation was both cruel and hollow. Finally, in early 1991, Erhard left the United States, preferring the solitude of self-imposed exile to the glare of harsh publicity.<br>Based on scores of interviews and an exhaustive examination of court records, testimony, and crucial documents, Outrageous Betrayal provides the first comprehensive account of Werner Erhard's meteoric rise and crashing fall.</p><p>Mud-slinging expos&#x201a; of the notorious pop guru who ``got it''- -and then tried to give it to the rest of the world. As his title makes clear, Pressman (a former writer for California Lawyer) makes no pretense to objectivity here: His Werner Erhard is a charismatic but abusive con man with a genius for repackaging and marketing others' ideas. Erhard, he tells us, was born in 1935 Pennsylvania as ``Jack Rosenberg''; grew up to be a married car-salesman with kids; fell in love and remarried, committing bigamy; changed his name to Werner Erhard; and moved with his new wife to California. There, while selling encyclopedias door-to-door, Erhard hooked up with Scientology and a teaching method called Mind Dynamics, then broke away to begin est. Within two years, est had expanded into a multimillion-dollar business whose confrontational, allegedly transformational, techniques had been sold to tens of thousands, including many celebrities. Pressman highlights est's little-known debt to Scientology and Mind Dynamics; traces the outfit's byzantine, perhaps shady, financial structure; emphasizes Erhard's sybaritic way of life and cult of personality; and hammers home the guru's bullying side--which, at its ugliest, may have led him to beat his wife and molest his daughters. What the author dramatically fails to provide by bearing down on the negative (to the extent that nearly all his informants denounce est and its founder) is any real understanding of est's teachings--and of why they appealed so deeply to so many. Today, Erhard, escaping bad publicity, is in exile, his whereabouts apparently unknown to the press, including Pressman: a suitably shadowy stage in the life of a man who remains an enigma despite a dogged telling here of what, surely, is only half the story. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Pressman, a San Francisco-based journalist, offers a compelling account of the 1980s guru who rose from selling used cars to peddling personal transformation. Erhard's dubious Est program--today known as The Forum--promises outlandish benefits in return for outlandish cash outlays. Like many of his predecessors, (notably L. Ron Hubbard, the demented fabricator of Scientology, whom Erhard briefly followed), Erhard progressed from a tireless, aggressive proselytizer to a psychotic egomaniac. Pressman skillfully documents Erhard's ascension to godlike status, and his irrevocable, shameful plummet following an episode that aired in 1991 on 60 Minutes , in which Erhard's daughter accused him of sexual abuse (a charge that Erhard allegedly deflected by characterizing it as "a nurturing experience"). Most public libraries should place this expose on the same shelves as Wendy Kaminer's I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional ( LJ 6/1/92).<br><i>- Mark Annichiarico, "Library Journal"</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Earthquake Terror</h2><p>Left at their Magpie Island campsite when their mother is rushed to the hospital with a broken ankle, Jonathan Palmer, his young sister, and the family dog struggle for survival when a terrible earthquake strikes.</p><p>Peg Kehret was born in Wisconsin, grew up in Minnesota, spent fourteen years in California, and now lives with her husband in Washington State.

Prolific author Kehret has a well-deserved reputation for writing good, solid thrillers for middle-graders. Even if the premise is a bit shaky (would parents really leave their children alone on a remote island?) and the ending disappoints just a bit, her latest is no exception. It pits a resourceful 12-year-old against the elements and has him come out on top. Jonathan doesn't think that taking care of his disabled 6-year-old sister, Abby, while his father rushes his mother to a hospital for a broken ankle will be too problematic--until nature intervenes. An earthquake rocks the tiny island where the children are staying, destroying the bridge to the mainland as well as the family's supplies and Abby's walker. Even more frightening is Jonathan's discovery that the quake has caused a nearby river to change its course: water is now rapidly flooding the tiny island. It will be a rare thriller fan who won't want to see what happens. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i></p><h2>In the Heart of the Sea : The Epic True Story That Inspired &#39;Moby Dick</h2><p>The Number One best-selling, epic true-life story of one of the most notorious maritime disasters of the 19th century, beautifully reissued alongside Philbrick&#39;s new paperback, Sea of Glory. The sinking of the whaleship Essex by an enraged spermwhale in the Pacific in November 1820 set in motion one of the most dramatic sea stories of all time: the twenty sailors who survived the wreck took to three small boats (one of which was again attacked by a whale) and only eight of them survived their subsequent 90-day ordeal, after resorting to cannibalising their mates. Three months after the Essex was broken up, the whaleship Dauphin, cruising off the coast of South America, spotted a small boat in the open ocean. As they pulled alongside they saw piles of bones in the bottom of the boat, at least two skeletons&#39; worth, with two survivors -- almost skeletons themselves -- sucking the marrow from the bones of their dead ship-mates.</p><p>The appeal of Dava Sobel's <i>Longitude</i> was, in part, that it illuminated a little-known piece of history through a series of captivating incidents and engaging personalities. Nathaniel Philbrick's <i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> is certainly cast from the same mold, examining the 19th-century Pacific whaling industry through the arc of the sinking of the whaleship <i>Essex</i> by a boisterous sperm whale. The story that inspired Herman Melville's classic <i>Moby-Dick</i> has a lot going for it--derring-do, cannibalism, rescue--and Philbrick proves an amiable and well-informed narrator, providing both context and detail. We learn about the importance and mechanics of blubber production--a vital source of oil--and we get the nuts and bolts of harpooning and life aboard whalers. We are spared neither the nitty-gritty of open boats nor the sucking of human bones dry.<p> By sticking to the tried and tested <i>Longitude</i> formula, Philbrick has missed a slight trick or two. The epicenter of the whaling industry was Nantucket, a small island off Cape Cod; most of the whales were in the Pacific, necessitating a huge journey around the southernmost tip of South America. We never learn why no one ever tried to create an alternative whaling capital somewhere nearer. Similarly, Philbrick tells us that the story of the <i>Essex</i> was well known to Americans for decades, but he never explores how such legends fade from our consciousness. Philbrick would no doubt reply that such questions were beyond his remit, and you can't exactly accuse him of skimping on his research. By any standard, 50 pages of footnotes impress, though he wears his learning lightly. He doesn't get bogged down in turgid detail, and his narrative rattles along at a nice pace. When the storyline is as good as this, you can't really ask for more. <i>--John Crace, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Secret Seder</h2><p>Jacques and his parents are hiding in Nazi-occupied France during World War II, pretending to be Catholics.

Rappaport lives and writes in upstate New York.Grade 2-6 - Amid the plethora of Holocaust children's literature emerges yet another picture book that uses the themes of exodus and freedom associated with Passover to contrast the reality of Nazi-occupied Europe. The narrator is a French boy whose family lives openly as Catholics, but secretly observes their Jewish faith. Despite the fear that their true identity will be discovered, he and his father attend an all-male Seder held in an abandoned shack in a nearby forest. They arrive with a roasted egg for the meager Seder plate, which lacks many of the traditional ingredients. One man says, "We have no bitter herbs to dip in salted water," while another replies, "We do not need bitter herbs....Our lives are bitter enough." The highlight of the evening is when the boy recites the four traditional questions, which he had secretly practiced with his mother. The men provide secondary answers to the customary ones: "I think tonight is different because tonight all over Europe, Jews are being murdered." Their sadness, fear, and misery are underscored by the idea that tonight they are free in their hearts and by their hope for a brighter future. Watercolors depicting gloomy, foreboding images of the village, forest, and shack counter the child's memories of happier meals at his grandmother's home. Rappaport interweaves themes and descriptive text to create a meaningful story in a distinctive setting. An excellent discussion starter.<i> - Rita Soltan, Oakland University, Rochester, MI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He opens a window on his private life, from his boyhood dislike of school to his daughter&#x2019;s precocious melancholy, from his successful struggle to quit smoking to his anxiety at the prospect of testifying against some clumsy muggers who fell upon him during a visit to New York City. From ordinary obligations such as applying for a passport or sharing a holiday meal with relatives, he takes extraordinary flights of imagination; in extreme moments, such as the terrifying days following a cataclysmic earthquake in Istanbul, he lays bare our most basic hopes and fears. Again and again Pamuk declares his faith in fiction, engaging the work of such predecessors as Laurence Sterne and Fyodor Dostoyevsky, sharing fragments from his notebooks, and commenting on his own novels. He contemplates his mysterious compulsion to sit alone at a desk and dream, always returning to the rich deliverance that is reading and writing.<br><br>By turns witty, moving, playful, and provocative,<i> Other Colors</i> glows with the energy of a master at work and gives us the world through his eyes, assigning every radiant theme and shifting mood&nbsp;its&nbsp;precise shade&nbsp;in the spectrum of significance.</p><p>Orhan Pamuk is the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature for 2006. His novel <i>My Name Is Red </i>won the 2003 IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. His work has been translated into more than fifty languages. He lives in Istanbul.<b>Chapter One: The Implied Author </b><br><br>I have been writing for thirty years. I have been reciting these words for some time now. I&#x2019;ve been reciting them for so long, in fact, that they have ceased to be true, for now I am entering into my thirty-first year as a writer. I do still like saying that I&#x2019;ve been writing novels for thirty years&#x2014;though this is a bit of an exaggeration. From time to time, I do other sorts of writing: essays, criticism, reflections on Istanbul or politics, and speeches. But my true vocation, the thing that binds me to life, is writing novels. There are plenty of brilliant writers who&#x2019;ve been writing much longer than I, who&#x2019;ve been writing for half a century without paying the matter much attention. There are also the great writers to whom I return again and again, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, and Thomas Mann, whose careers spanned more than fifty years. . . . So why do I make so much of my thirtieth anniversary as a writer? I do so because I wish to talk about writing, and most particularly novel writing, as a habit. <br><br>In order to be happy I must have my daily dose of literature. In this I am no different from the patient who must take a spoon of medicine each day. When I learned, as a child, that diabetics needed an injection every day, I felt bad for them as anyone might; I may even have thought of them as half dead. My dependence on literature must make me half dead in the same way. Especially when I was a young writer, I sensed that others saw me as cut off from the real world and so doomed to be &#x201c;half dead.&#x201d; Or perhaps the right term is &#x201c;half a ghost.&#x201d; I have sometimes even entertained the thought that I was fully dead and trying to breathe life back into my corpse with literature. For me, literature is a medicine. Like the medicine that others take by spoon or injection, my daily dose of literature&#x2014;my daily fix, if you will&#x2014;must meet certain standards. <br><br>First, the medicine must be good. Its goodness is what tells me how true and potent it is. To read a dense, deep passage in a novel, to enter into that world and believe it to be true&#x2014;nothing makes me happier, nothing more surely binds me to life. I also prefer that the writer be dead, because then there is no little cloud of jealousy to darken my admiration. The older I get, the more convinced I am that the best books are by dead writers. Even if they are not yet dead, to sense their presence is to sense a ghost. This is why, when we see great writers in the street, we treat them like ghosts, not quite believing our eyes as we marvel from a distance. A few brave souls approach the ghosts for autographs. Sometimes I remind myself that these writers will die soon and, once they are dead, the books that are their legacy will occupy an even more cherished place in our hearts. Though of course this is not always the case. <br><br>If my daily dose of literature is something I myself am writing, it&#x2019;s all very different. Because for those who share my affliction, the best cure of all, and the greatest source of happiness, is to write a good half page every day. For thirty years I&#x2019;ve spent an average of ten hours a day alone in a room, sitting at my desk. If you count only the work that is good enough to be published, my daily average is a good deal less than half a page. Most of what I write does not meet my own standards of quality control. These, I put to you, are two great sources of misery. <br><br>But please don&#x2019;t misunderstand me: A writer who is as dependent on literature as I am can never be so superficial as to find happiness in the beauty of the books he has already written, nor can he congratulate himself on their number or what these books achieved. Literature does not allow such a writer to pretend to save the world; rather, it gives him a chance to save the day. And all days are difficult. Days are especially difficult when you don&#x2019;t do any writing. When you cannot do any writing. The point is to find enough hope to get through the day, and, if the book or the page you are reading is good, to find joy in it, and happiness, if only for a day. <br><br>Let me explain what I feel on a day when I&#x2019;ve not written well, am unable to lose myself in a book. First, the world changes before my eyes; it becomes unbearable, abominable. Those who know me can see it happening, for I myself come to resemble the world I see around me. For example, my daughter can tell I have not written well that day from the abject hopelessness on my face in the evening. I would like to be able to hide this from her, but I cannot. During these dark moments, I feel as if there is no line between life and death. I don&#x2019;t want to speak to anyone&#x2014;just as well, since no one seeing me in this state has any desire to speak to me either. A mild version of this despair descends on me every afternoon, between one and three, but I have learned how to treat it with reading and writing: If I act promptly, I can spare myself a full retreat into death-in-life. <br><br>If I&#x2019;ve had to go a long stretch without my paper-and-ink cure, be it due to travel, an unpaid gas bill, military service (as was once the case), political affairs (as has been the case more recently), or any number of other obstacles, I can feel misery setting inside me like cement. My body has difficulty moving, my joints get stiff, my head turns to stone, my perspiration even seems to smell differently. This misery is likely to grow, for life is full of things that conspire to keep a person from literature. I might be sitting in a crowded political meeting, or chatting with my classmates in a school corridor, or eating a holiday meal with my relatives, struggling to converse with a well-meaning person of unlike mind, or occupied with whatever is on the TV screen; I can be at an important business meeting or making an ordinary purchase, making my way to the notary or having my picture taken for a visa&#x2014;when suddenly my eyelids grow heavy and, though it is the middle of the day, I fall asleep. When I am far from home, and so unable to return to my room to spend time alone, my only consolation is a nap in the middle of the day. <br><br>So yes, the real hunger here is not for literature but for a room where I can be alone with my thoughts. In such a room I can invent beautiful dreams about those same crowded places&#x2014;those family gatherings, school reunions, festive dinners, and all the people who attend them. I enrich the crowded holiday meals with imagined details and make the people themselves more amusing. In dreams, of course, everything and everyone is interesting, captivating, and real. I make the new world from the stuff of the known world. Here we come to the heart of the matter. To write well, I must first be bored to distraction; to be bored to distraction, I must enter into life. It is when I am bombarded with noise, sitting in an office full of ringing phones, surrounded by friends and loved ones on a sunny seashore or at a rainy funeral&#x2014;in other words, at the very moment when I begin to sense the heart of the scene unfolding around me&#x2014;that I will suddenly feel as if I&#x2019;m no longer really there but watching from the sidelines. I&#x2019;ll begin to daydream. If I&#x2019;m feeling pessimistic, I think only about how bored I am. Either way, a voice inside urges me to go back to the room and sit down at the table. <br><br>I have no idea how most people answer such voices, but my manner of response turns people like me into writers. My guess is that it turns us more typically into writers of prose and of fiction than of verse. Here, then, is a bit more insight into the properties of the medicine I must make sure to take every day. We can see now that its active ingredients are boredom, real life, and the life of the imagination. <br><br>The pleasure I take in this confession and the fear I feel speaking honestly about myself&#x2014;together they lead me to a serious and important insight I would now like to share with you. I would like to propose a simple theory that begins from the idea that writing is a solace, even a remedy, at least for novelists like me: We choose our subjects, and shape our novels, to suit our daily daydream requirements. A novel is inspired by ideas, passions, furies, and desires&#x2014;this we all know. To please our lovers, to belittle our enemies, to extol something we adore, to delight in speaking authoritatively about something of which we know nothing, to take pleasure in times lost and remembered, to dream of making love or reading or engaging with politics, to indulge in one&#x2019;s particular worries, one&#x2019;s personal habits&#x2014;these and any number of other obscure or even nonsensical desires are what shape us, in ways both clear and mysterious. . . . These same desires inspire the daydreams to which we give voice. We may not understand where they come from or what, if anything, our daydreams may signify, but when we sit down to write it is our daydreams that breathe life into us, as wind from an unknown place stirs an aeolian harp. One might even say that we surrender to this mysterious wind like a captain who has no idea where he&#x2019;s bound. <br><br>At the same time, in one part of our minds, we can pinpoint our location on the map exactly, just as we can remember the point toward which we are traveling. Even at those times when I surrender unconditionally to the wind, I am able&#x2014;at least according to some other writers I know and admire&#x2014;to retain my general sense of direction. Before I set out I will have made plans: divided the story I wish to tell into sections, determined which ports my ship will visit and what loads it will carry and drop off along the way, estimated the time of my journey, and charted its course. But if the wind, having blown in from unknown quarters and filled my sails, decides to change the direction of my story, I will not resist. For what the ship most ardently seeks is the feeling of wholeness and perfection in plying its way under full sail. It is as if I am looking for that special place and time in ...</p><h2>Tender Mercies: Inside the World of a Child Abuse Investigator</h2><p>This first-person, emotional account of a child protection service worker in New York State gives the reader an intimate look at all aspects of handling child abuse cases: interviewing parents who have been accused of abusing their children, talking to abused children removed from their parents&#39; guardianship, working with an uncaring system ironically designed with the best of intentions, and keeping up with the mounds of paperwork each case generates. Lucid and disturbing, eloquent and passionate, Tender Mercies is a must-read for professionals and laypeople alike!</p><p></p><h2>The Road Home: A Novel</h2><p>In the wake of factory closings and his beloved wife's death, Lev is on his way from Eastern Europe to London, seeking work to support his mother and his little daughter. After a spell of homelessness, he finds a job in the kitchen of a posh restaurant, and a room in the house of an appealing Irishman who has also lost his family. Never mind that Lev must sleep in a bunk bed surrounded by plastic toys--he has found a friend and shelter. However constricted his life in England remains he compensates by daydreaming of home, by having an affair with a younger restaurant worker (and dodging the attentions of other women), and by trading gossip and ambitions via cell phone with his hilarious old friend Rudi who, dreaming of the wealthy West, lives largely for his battered Chevrolet.<br> Homesickness dogs Lev, not only for nostalgic reasons, but because he doesn't belong, body or soul, to his new country-but can he really go home again? Rose Tremain's prodigious talents as a prose writer are on full display in THE ROAD HOME, but her novel never loses sight of what is truly important in the lives we lead.</p><p>Rose Tremain lives in Norfolk and London with the biographer Richard Holmes.Juliet Stevenson&#39;s performance of THE ROAD HOME is nothing short of astonishing. Tremain&#39;s protagonist, Lev, emigrating from an Eastern Bloc country to work in the UK, speaks with a Slavic accent. In his homesick struggles to survive in a foreign culture completely different from his expectations, he meets people with Qatari, Irish, posh-Brit, old-lady, drunk-man, Chinese, Cockney, and young-girl voices. Stevenson renders each so impeccably, and makes them so distinct in timbre and personality as well as accent, that you utterly lose track of the fact that it&#39;s all created by one actor. Most of all, she delivers a moving story of one immigrant who occasionally does unwise or dopey things but never loses our interest or sympathy. Cause for celebration. B.G.

Her job as a sales rep means that she&#x2019;s often talking to new people, which she loves. An attractive woman in her late twenties, she went through a long period of dating before she finally settled on her current boyfriend, Brian.<br><br>Brian can be sweet, protective, and considerate, but he&#x2019;s also an anxious, fearful guy who treats every new person with suspicion. When the two of them go on a walk together, Katie is outgoing and talkative, easily falling into conversation with the man who stops to ask directions or the woman whose dog cuts across their path. Brian, though, is full of criticism. Can&#x2019;t she see how people are laughing at her? She thinks they like these casual conversations, but they&#x2019;re actually rolling their eyes and wondering why she&#x2019;s so chatty. And that man who asked them for directions? He was only trying to seduce her&#x2014;she should have seen how he leered at her the moment her back was turned. Besides, behaving in such a manner is highly disrespectful to him, her boyfriend. How does she think it makes him feel to see her making eyes at every guy she passes?<br><br>At first, Katie laughs off her boyfriend&#x2019;s complaints. She&#x2019;s been like this all her life, she tells him, and she enjoys being friendly. But after weeks of relentless criticism, she starts to doubt herself. Maybe people are laughing and leering at her. Maybe she is being flirtatious and rubbing her boyfriend&#x2019;s nose in it&#x2014;what a terrible way to treat the man who loves her!<br><br>Eventually, when Katie walks down the street, she can&#x2019;t decide how to behave. She doesn&#x2019;t want to give up her warm and friendly approach to the world&#x2014;but now, whenever she smiles at a stranger, she can&#x2019;t help imagining what Brian would think.<br>LIZ is a top&#x2013;level executive in a major advertising firm. A stylish woman in her late forties with a solid, twenty&#x2013;year marriage and no children, she&#x2019;s worked hard to get where she is, pouring all her extra energy into her career. Now she seems to be on the verge of reaching her goal, in line to take over the company&#x2019;s New York office.<br><br>Then, at the last minute, someone else is brought in to take the job. Liz swallows her pride and offers to give him all the help she can. At first, the new boss seems charming and appreciative. But soon Liz starts to notice that she&#x2019;s being left out of important decisions and not invited to major meetings. She hears rumors that clients are being told she doesn&#x2019;t want to work with them anymore and has recommended that they speak to her new boss instead. When she complains to her colleagues, they look at her in bewilderment. &#x201c;But he always praises you to the skies,&#x201d; they insist. &#x201c;Why would he say such nice things if he was out to get you?&#x201d;<br><br>Finally, Liz confronts her boss, who has a plausible explanation for every incident. &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; he says kindly at the end of the meeting. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re being way too sensitive about all this&#x2014;maybe even a little paranoid. Would you like a few days off to destress?&#x201d;<br><br>Liz feels completely disabled. She <i>knows</i> she&#x2019;s being sabotaged&#x2014;but why is she the only one who thinks so?<br>MITCHELL is a grad student in his mid&#x2013;twenties who&#x2019;s studying to become an electrical engineer. Tall, gangly, and somewhat shy, he&#x2019;s taken a long time to find the right woman, but he&#x2019;s just begun dating someone he really likes. One day, his girlfriend mildly points out that Mitchell still dresses like a little boy. Mitchell is mortified, but he sees what she means. Off he goes to a local department store, where he asks the personal shopper to help him choose an entire wardrobe. The clothes make him feel like a new man&#x2014;sophisticated, attractive&#x2014;and he enjoys the appreciative glances women give him on the bus ride home.<br><br>But when he wears the new clothes to Sunday dinner at his parents&#x2019; home, his mother bursts out laughing. &#x201c;Oh, Mitchell, that outfit is all wrong for you&#x2014;you look ridiculous,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Please, dear, the next time you go shopping, let me help you.&#x201d; When Mitchell feels hurt and asks his mother to apologize, she shakes her head sadly. &#x201c;I was only trying to help,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;d like an apology from <i>you</i> for that tone of voice.&#x201d;<br><br>Mitchell is confused. He liked his new clothes&#x2014;but maybe he does look ridiculous. And has he really been rude to his mother?<br><b>Understanding the Gaslight Effect</b><br><br>Katie, Liz, and Mitchell have one thing in common: they&#x2019;re all suffering from the Gaslight Effect. The Gaslight Effect results from a relationship between two people: a gaslighter, who needs to be right in order to preserve his own sense of self and his sense of having power in the world; and a gaslightee, who allows the gaslighter to define her sense of reality because she idealizes him and seeks his approval. Gaslighters and gaslightees can be of either gender, and gaslighting can happen in any type of relationship. But I&#x2019;m going to call gaslighters &#x201c;he&#x201d; and gaslightees &#x201c;she,&#x201d; since that&#x2019;s the pairing I most often see in my practice. I&#x2019;ll explore a variety of relationships&#x2014;with friends, family, bosses, and colleagues&#x2014;but the male&#x2013;female romantic pairing will be my major focus.<br><br>For example, Katie&#x2019;s gaslighting boyfriend insists that the world is a dangerous place and that Katie&#x2019;s behavior is inappropriate and insensitive. When he feels stressed or threatened, he <i>has</i> to be right about these issues, and he has to get Katie to agree that he is. Katie values the relationship and doesn't want to lose Brian, so she starts to see things from his point of view. Maybe the people they meet <i>are</i> laughing at her. Maybe she <i>is</i> being flirtatious. Gaslighting has begun.<br><br>Likewise, Liz&#x2019;s boss insists that he really cares about her and that any concerns she has are because she&#x2019;s paranoid. Liz wants her boss to think well of her&#x2014;after all, her career is at stake&#x2014;so she starts to doubt her own perceptions and tries to adopt his. But her boss&#x2019;s view of things really doesn&#x2019;t make sense to Liz. If he&#x2019;s <i>not</i> trying to sabotage her, why is she missing all those meetings? Why are her clients failing to return her calls? Why is she feeling so worried and confused? Liz is so trusting that she just can&#x2019;t believe anyone could be as blatantly manipulative as her boss seems to be; she <i>has</i> to be doing something that warrants his terrible treatment. Wishing desperately for her boss to be right, but knowing deep down that he isn&#x2019;t, makes Liz feels completely disoriented, no longer sure of what she sees or what she knows. Her gaslighting is in full swing.<br><br>Mitchell&#x2019;s mother insists that she&#x2019;s entitled to say anything she wants to her son and that he is being rude if he objects. Mitchell would like to see his mother as a good, loving person, not as someone who says mean things to him. So when she hurts his feelings, he blames himself, not her. Both Mitchell and his mother agree: the mother is right, and Mitchell is wrong. Together, they are creating the Gaslight Effect.<br><br>Of course, Katie, Liz, and Mitchell all have other choices. Katie might ignore her boyfriend's negative remarks, ask him to stop making them, or as a last resort, break up with him. Liz could say to herself, &#x201c;Wow, this new boss is a piece of work. Well; maybe that smarmy charm has fooled everyone else in this company&#x2014;but not me!&#x201d; Mitchell might reply calmly, &#x201c;Sorry, Mom, but you&#x2019;re the one who owes <i>me </i>an apology.&#x201d; All of them could decide that, on some basic level, they are willing to live with their gaslighters&#x2019; disapproval. <i>They</i> know they are good, capable, lovable people, and that&#x2019;s all that matters.<br><br>If our three gaslightees were able to take this attitude, there would be no gaslighting. Maybe their gaslighters would still behave badly, but their behavior would no longer have such a pernicious effect. Gaslighting works only when you believe what the gaslighter says and need him to think well of you.<br><br>The problem is, gaslighting is insidious. It plays on our worst fears, our most anxious thoughts, our deepest wishes to be understood, appreciated, and loved. When someone we trust, respect, or love speaks with great certainty--especially if there&#x2019;s a grain of truth in his words, or if he&#x2019;s hit on one of our pet anxieties&#x2014;it can be very difficult not to believe him. And when we idealize the gaslighter&#x2014;when we want to see him as the love of our life, an admirable boss, or a wonderful parent&#x2014;then we have even more difficulty sticking to our own sense of reality. Our gaslighter needs to be right, we need to win his approval, and so the gaslighting goes on.<br><br>Of course, neither of you may be aware of what&#x2019;s really happening. The gaslighter may genuinely believe every word he tells you or sincerely feel that he&#x2019;s only saving you from yourself. Remember: He&#x2019;s being driven by his own needs. Your gaslighter might seem like a strong, powerful man, or he may appear to be an insecure, tantrum&#x2013;throwing little boy; either way, he <i>feels</i> weak and powerless. To feel powerful and safe, he <i>has</i> to prove that he is right, and he <i>has</i> to get you to agree with him.<br><br>Meanwhile, you have idealized your gaslighter and are desperate for his approval, although you may not consciously realize this. But if there&#x2019;s even a little piece of you that thinks you&#x2019;re not good enough by yourself&#x2014;if even a small part of you feels you need your gaslighter&#x2019;s love or approval to be whole&#x2014;then you are susceptible to gaslighting.

Drawing from research and personal experience, he shows that only by reclaiming their lost past and proud heritage can blacks lay the foundation for their future. And white Americans can begin making reparations for slavery and the century of racial discrimination that followed with monetary restitution, educational programs, and the kinds of equal opportunities that will ensure the social and economic success of all citizens.<br><b><br>&#x201c;Engaging...Robinson continues an important conversation...His anecdotes support his attempts to reclaim African American heritage and empower African Americans.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i></b></p></p><p>Randall Robinson, the founder and president of TransAfrica (a lobbying organization dedicated to influencing U.S. policy toward Africa and the Caribbean), recounted his heroic struggle to fight and overcome racism in the magnificent <i>Defending the Spirit</i>. In his triumphant follow-up, <i>The Debt</i>, he goes further than any previous black public figure in calling for reparations to African-Americans for the present-day racism that stems from 246 years of slavery. Citing compensation that Jews and Japanese Americans have received, he writes, "No race, ethnic or religious group has suffered as much over so long a span as blacks have and do still, at the hands of those who benefited ... from slavery and the century of legalized American racial hostility that followed it." In making his case, Robinson utilizes facts and figures that highlight the disparity between African-Americans and whites. While fully recognizing the monumental odds of this movement's success, Robinson feels that the push for reparations will also greatly benefit African-Americans in nonmaterial ways: "Even the making of a well-reasoned case for restitution will do wonders for the spirit of African-Americans," he argues. "It will cause them to at long last understand the genesis of their history--before, during, and after slavery--into one story of themselves." <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i><b>Randall Robinson</b> is the founder and president of TransAfrica, the organization that spearheaded the movement to influence U.S. policies toward international black leadership.

At once artist, composer, editor, teacher, wife, and mother of eight children, she was an important force in the musical world of her time. To show how Schumann surmounted the obstacles facing female artists in the nineteenth century, Nancy B. Reich has drawn on previously unexplored primary sources: unpublished diaries, letters, and family papers, as well as concert programs. Going beyond the familiar legends of the Schumann literature, she applies the tools of musicological scholarship and the insights of psychology to provide a new, full-scale portrait.</p><p>The book is divided into two parts. In Part One, Reich follows Clara Schumann's life from her early years as a child prodigy through her marriage to Robert Schumann and into the forty years after his death, when she established and maintained an extraordinary European career while supporting and supervising a household and seven children. Part Two covers four major themes in Schumann's life: her relationship with Johannes Brahms and other friends and contemporaries; her creative work; her life on the concert stage; and her success as a teacher.</p><p>Throughout, excerpts from diaries and letters in Reich's own translations clear up misconceptions about her life and achievements and her partnership with Robert Schumann. Highlighting aspects of Clara Schumann's personality and character that have been neglected by earlier biographers, this candid and eminently readable account adds appreciably to our understanding of a fascinating artist and woman.</p><p>For this revised edition, Reich has added several photographs and updated the text to include recent discoveries. She has also prepared a Catalogue of Works that includes all of Clara Schumann's known published and unpublished compositions and works she edited, as well as descriptions of the autographs, the first editions, the modern editions, and recent literature on each piece. The Catalogue also notes Schumann's performances of her own music and provides pertinent quotations from letters, diaries, and contemporary reviews.</p></p><p><p>Nancy B. Reich received her Ph.D. from New York University and has served on the faculties of Queens College, New York University, Manhattanville College, and was a Visiting Professor of Music at Bard College and Williams College. In 1996, she was awarded the Robert Schumann Prize of the City of Zwickau, Germany.</p><p>"Reich's first edition contributed to the increase in interest in Clara Schumann and in the performances and recordings of her music. The publication of this revised edition will continue to stir interest with the availability of new documents, letters and the extensive list of newly published music; further, this new edition offers a much more detailed look at Clara Schumann's life and music."</p> (<i>Journal of the International Association of Women in Music</i>)<br><br><p>"The marvelous originality of Reich's book lies in the way she places the marriage and the celebrated friendship with Brahms in perspective among other critical factors in Clara's life. Reich's painstaking, scholarly detail and feminist insight recover not merely the events in the life, dramatic as they were, but its major themes, movements and connecting threads."</p> (<i>Women's Review of Books</i>)<br><br><p>"Foremost among the strengths of this book is the delineation of Schumann's character. While pointing out the overwhelming challenges and devastating losses that dogged her entire life, Reich makes no attempt to paint her as a saint or hero.... The first edition of this book has gained acceptance as a standard resource on Clara Schumann. This revised edition preserves the strengths of the first edition while adding additional information and a fine-tuning of the presentation, assuring that Reich's work will remain central to the subject for the foreseeable future."</p> (<i>Notes: Journal of the Music Library Association</i>)<br><br><p>"In addition to telling us the story of Clara Schumann's life, Nancy B. Reich... includes chapters on Clara Schumann's children, her work as editor, performing artist, and teacher, and her relationships with Brahms, Joachim, Liszt, and other major figures of the era.... There is also a list and analysis of Clara Schumann's compositions.... Reich has written an eminently readable, well-researched, and thoughtful book that gives historical and psychological insights into one of the major artists of the nineteenth century."</p> (<i>Classical Music Guide Forums</i>)<br><br><p>"Clara Schumann was one of the remarkable women of the nineteenth century, and she deserves this well-documented biography.... This is the best modern study of Clara Schumann available in English."</p> (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>)</p><h2>Christopher Lee: Tall, Dark and Gruesome</h2><p>International film actor Christopher Lee details his childhood, war years, friendships with Peter Cushing, Vincent Price, Robert Bloch and Boris Karloff, and, of course, his varied and interesting film career.

The official report, in fact, did not conclude that Forrestal committed suicide. It concluded only that the fall caused his death and that no one in the U.S. Navy was responsible for it. A major reason why the suicide thesis is still widely believed is that the news of the release of the official report, which the author obtained through the Freedom of Information Act in 2004, has been effectively suppressed. Building upon what he has long made available on his DCDave.com web site, and in the manner of his 2018 book, The Martyrdom of Thomas Merton: An Investigation, co-authored with Hugh Turley, David Martin breaks through the wall of silence and misinformation. This meticulous examination of the violent death of the leading government critic of American support for the creation of the state of Israel is vital to an understanding of U.S. and world history since the mid-20th century.</p><p><p>David Martin's meticulously researched book provides a compelling account of the death of America's first Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, not as a suicide, but as murder at the hands of the Zionists. E. Michael Jones</p><p>This profoundly important book describes in detail one of the earliest plots of the "Deep State" as it was constituted post-WWII. The timeworn myths intended to support [James Forrestal's] "suicide"...have been systematically deconstructed by Martin. - Phillip F.

Gavin launched <i>Zen Pencils</i> at the start of 2012, a cartoon blog which adapts inspirational quotes into comic stories, and hasn't looked back since."Inspired by motivational posters that match uplifting sayings with dramatic images, Than fuses inspirational quotes with his own comics panels and in the process creates something finer than simply the sum of the two in this debut collection. A combination of quotes from both the classic (Thoreau, Twain, Confucius) and contemporary (Neil Gaiman, Ira Glass, Neil DeGrasse Tyson) are melded with cartoon art whose simplicity initially disguises its energetic dynamism. Than has chosen a range of stimulating and nurturing ideas, but the interconnection with competent and amusing comic strips pulls this above the usual collection of "never say die" anthologies. The book's emphasis is on artistic creativity: how to rise above the complications and setbacks (online trolls, discouraging relatives, mundane life) to find your own happiness and success in creating something. The sometimes literal, sometimes metaphorical adaptations are charming, funny, and pointedly invigorating. Than's website has been an online success and the book will introduce him to an even larger audience.

Free of the burden of a ten-year marriage, and free of the endlessly tedious year of deep mourning that had succeeded the death of the duke, her husband.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>It was a freedom that had been a long time coming. It was a freedom well worth celebrating.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>She had married the duke after a five-day acquaintance--his grace, all impatience to be wed, had procured a special license rather than wait for the banns to be read--when she was nineteen and he was somewhere in his seventies. No one seemed certain ofexactly where in his seventies that had been, though some said it was perilously close to eighty. At the time of her marriage, the duchess was a breathtakingly lovely girl, with a slender, lithe figure, eyes that rivaled a summer sky for blueness, a bright,eager face made for smiling, and long, wavy tresses that were almost white in their blondness--a shimmering white. The duke, on the other hand, had a body and face and head that showed all the ravages of age that time and years of hard living could possiblyhave piled upon them. And he suffered from gout. And from a heart that could no longer be relied upon to continue beating with steady regularity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>She married him for his money, of course, expecting to be a very rich widow indeed within a matter of a few short years at most. She was a rich widow now, quite fabulously wealthy, in fact, though she had had to wait longer than expected for the freedomto enjoy her riches to the full.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The old duke had worshiped the ground she walked upon, to use the old cliche. He had heaped so many costly clothes upon her person that she would have suffocated beneath their weight if she had ever tried to wear them all at once. A guest room next toher dressing room at Dunbarton House on Hanover Square in London had been converted into a second dressing room merely to accommodate all the silks and satins and furs--among other garments and accessories--that had been worn once, perhaps twice, before beingdiscarded for something newer. And the duke had had not one, not two, not even three, but four safes built into the walls of his own bedchamber to safeguard all the jewels with which he gifted his beloved over the years, though she was perfectly free to comeand fetch whichever of them she chose to wear at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He had been a doting, indulgent husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The duchess was always gorgeously dressed. And she was always bedecked with jewels, ostentatiously large ones, usually diamonds. She wore them in her hair, in the lobes of her ears, at her bosom, on her wrists, on more than one of the fingers of each hand.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; The duke showed off his prize wherever he went, beaming with pride and adoration as he looked up at her. In his prime he would have been taller than she, but age had bent him and a cane supported him, and for much of his time he sat. His duchess did notstray far from his side when they were together, even when they were at a ball and prospective partners abounded. She tended him with her characteristic half-smile playing always about her lovely lips. She was always the picture of wifely devotion on such occasions.Nobody could deny that.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>When the duke could not go out himself--and it became increasingly difficult for him to do so as the years went on--then other men escorted his duchess to the social events with which the ton amused itself whenever it was in town in large numbers. Therewere three in particular--Lord Hardingraye, Sir Bradley Bentley, and Viscount Zimmer--all handsome, elegant, charming gentlemen. It was common knowledge that they enjoyed her company and that she enjoyed theirs. And no one was ever in any doubt of what wasincluded in that enjoyment. The only detail people wondered about--and wonder they did, of course, without ever reaching a satisfactory conclusion--was whether all that pleasure was enjoyed with the duke's knowledge or without.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>There were some who even dared wonder if it was all done with the duke's blessing. But deliciously scandalous as it might have been to believe so, most people actually liked the duke--especially as he was now elderly and therefore deserving of pity--andpreferred to see him as a poor wronged old man. The same people liked to refer to the duchess as that diamond-laden gold digger, often with the addition of who is no better than she ought to be. Those people tended to be female.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And then the duchess's dazzling social life and scandalous loves and dreary incarceration in a union with an aged, ailing husband had all ended abruptly with the duke's ultimately sudden demise from a heart seizure early one morning. Though it was notnearly as early in the marriage as the duchess had hoped and expected, of course. She had her fortune at last, but she had paid dearly for it. She had paid with her youth. She was twenty-nine when he died, thirty when she left off her mourning soon after Christmasat Copeland, her country home in Kent that the duke had bought for her so that she would not have to leave when he died and his nephew took over his title and all his entailed properties. Copeland Manor was its full name, though the house was more mansion thanthe name implied and was surrounded by a correspondingly large park.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; And so, at the age of thirty, the best years of her youth behind her, the Duchess of Dunbarton was free at last. And wealthy beyond belief. And very ready to celebrate her freedom. As soon as Easter had come and gone, she moved to London and settled infor the Season. It was at Dunbarton House she settled, the new duke being a genial man of middle years who preferred tramping about the country counting his sheep to being in town sitting in the Upper House of Parliament listening to his peers prosing on foreverabout matters that might be of crucial importance to the country and even the world but were of no interest whatsoever to him. Politicians were all prize bores, he would tell anyone who cared to listen. And being a man without a wife, he had no one to pointout to him that sitting in the Upper House was only the most minor of reasons for the spring gathering of the ton in London. The duchess might occupy Dunbarton House and have a ball there every night with his blessing. And so he informed her. Provided, thatwas, she did not send him the bills.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>That last was a comment typical of his rather parsimonious nature. The duchess had no need to send her bills to anyone. She was enormously wealthy in her own right. She could pay them herself.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>She might be past her youth, and really thirty was a quite nasty age for a woman, but she was still incredibly beautiful. No one could deny that, even though there were a few who would have done so if they could. Indeed, she was probably more beautifulnow than she had been at the age of nineteen. She had gained just a little weight during the intervening years, and she had gained it in all the right places and none in any of the wrong places. She was still slender, but she was now deliciously curvaceous.Her face, less bright and eager than it had been when she was a girl, had settled pleasingly into its perfect bone structure and complexion. She smiled frequently, though her characteristic smile was half arrogant, half alluring, and altogether mysterious,as though she smiled at something inside herself rather than at the outside world. Her eyes had acquired a certain droop of the eyelids that suggested bedchambers and dreams and more secrets. And her hair, at the hands of experts, was always immaculately styled--butin such a way that it looked as if it might tumble into luxuriant disarray at any moment. The fact that it never did made it only the more intriguing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Her hair was her best feature, many people said. Except for her eyes, perhaps. Or her figure. Or her teeth, which were very white and perfectly formed and perfectly aligned with one another.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; All this was how the ton saw the Duchess of Dunbarton and her marriage to the elderly duke and her return to London as a wealthy widow who was free at last. &nbsp; No one knew, of course. No one had been inside that marriage to know how it had worked, or not worked. No one but the duke and duchess themselves, that was. The duke had become more and more reclusive in his final years, and the duchess had had hordesof acquaintances but no close friend that anyone knew of. She had been content to hide in plain sight within the air of luxury and mystery she exuded.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The ton, which had never tired of wondering about her during the ten years of her marriage, wondered again now after a one-year interval. She was a favorite topic in drawing rooms and at dinner tables, in fact. The ton wondered what she would do with herlife now that she was free. She had been Miss Nobody from Nowhere when she reeled in the great prize of the Duke of Dunbarton and persuaded him to marry for the first time in his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>What would she do next?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Someone else wondered what the duchess would do with her future, but she actually did it in the hearing of the one person who could satisfy her curiosity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Barbara Leavensworth had been the duchess's friend since they were both children living in the same neighborhood in Lincolnshire, Barbara as the vicar's daughter, Hannah as the daughter of a landowner of respectable birth and moderate means. Barbara stilllived in the same village with her parents, though they had moved out of the vicarage a year ago when her father retired. Barbara had recently become betrothed to the new vicar. They were to marry in August.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The two childhood friends had remained close, even if not geographically. The duchess had never gone back to her former home after her marriage, and though Barbara had been frequently invited to stay with her, she had not often accepted, and even whenshe had, she had not stayed as long as Hannah would have liked. She had been too intimidated by the duke. And so they had kept up their friendship by letter. They had written to each other, usually at great length, at least once a week for eleven years.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Now Barbara had accepted an invitation to spend some time in London with the duchess. They would shop for her bride clothes in the only place in England worth shopping in, the duchess had written as an inducement. Which was all very well, Barbara had thoughtwhen she read the letter, shaking her head in slight exasperation, when one had pots of money, as Hannah did and she most certainly did not. But Hannah needed the company now that she was alone, and she rather fancied a few weeks of exploring churches and museumsto her heart's content before finally settling down. The Reverend Newcombe, her betrothed, encouraged her to go and enjoy herself and lend her support to the poor widow, her friend. And then, when she decided that she would go, he insisted that she take anastonishingly large sum of money with which to buy herself some pretty dresses and perhaps a bonnet or two. And her parents, who thought a month or so with Hannah, of whom they had always been inordinately fond, would be a wonderful thing for their daughterbefore she settled to a sober life as the vicar's wife, pressed a largish sum of spending money on her too.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Barbara felt quite decadently rich when she arrived at Dunbarton House after a journey during which it had felt as though every bone in her body had been jolted into a new, less comfortable position.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Hannah was waiting for her inside the hall, and they hugged and squealed and exclaimed over each other for several minutes, both talking, neither listening, and laughing over nothing at all except the sheer happiness of being together again. The ton, ifthey could have seen Hannah, might have been forgiven if they had not recognized her. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes wide and bright, her smile broad, her voice almost shrill with excitement and delight. There was not the merest suggestion of mystery abouther.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And then she became aware of the silent figure of the housekeeper in the background, and she relinquished Barbara to her competent care. She paced aimlessly in the drawing room while her friend was taken up to her room to wash her hands and face and changeher dress and comb her hair and otherwise use up half an hour before being brought down for tea.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; She was looking her neat, tranquil self again. Dear, dependable Barbara, whom she loved more than anyone else still living, Hannah thought as she beamed at her and crossed the room to hug her again.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"I am so, so happy that you came, Babs," she said. She laughed. "Just in case you did not understand that when you arrived."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Well, I did think you might have shown just a little enthusiasm," Barbara said, and they both laughed again.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Hannah suddenly tried to remember when she had last laughed, and could not recall an occasion. No matter. One was not meant to laugh while one was in mourning. Someone might call one heartless.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; They talked without ceasing for all of an hour, this time both listening and talking, before Barbara asked the question that had been uppermost in her mind since the Duke of Dunbarton's death, though she had not broached it in any of her letters.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"What are you going to do now, Hannah?" she asked, leaning forward in her chair. "You must be dreadfully lonely without the duke. You adored each other."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Barbara was probably one of the few people in London, or in all of England for that matter, who truly believed such a startling notion. Perhaps the only one, in fact.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; "We did," Hannah said with a sigh. She spread one hand on her lap and regarded the rings she wore on three of her well-manicured fingers. She smoothed her hand over the fine white muslin of her dress. "I do miss him. I keep thinking of all sorts of absurditiesI simply must rush home to share with him, only to remember that he is not here any longer waiting to hear them."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; "But I know," Barbara said, her voice earnest in its sympathy, "that he suffered dreadfully with his gout and that his heart was giving him much pain and trouble in his last years. I daresay it was a blessing that he went quickly in the end."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Hannah felt inappropriately amused. Barbara would make an excellent vicar's wife if her head was full of platitudes like that one.</p><h2>Walnut and Steel II: More Vintage .22 Rifles</h2><p>This is an all new book about vintage .22 rifles.

The group, whose ballot symbol was a snarling black panther, was formed in part to protest the barriers to black enfranchisement that had for decades kept every single African American of voting age off the county&#x2019;s registration books. Even after the passage of the Voting Rights Act, most African Americans in this overwhelmingly black county remained too scared even to try to register. Their fear stemmed from the county&#x2019;s long, bloody history of whites retaliating against blacks who strove to exert the freedom granted to them after the Civil War.<br>Amid this environment of intimidation and disempowerment, African Americans in Lowndes County viewed the LCFO as the best vehicle for concrete change. Their radical experiment in democratic politics inspired black people throughout the country, from SNCC organizer Stokely Carmichael who used the Lowndes County program as the blueprint for Black Power, to California-based activists Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton, who adopted the LCFO panther as the namesake for their new, grassroots organization: the Black Panther Party for Self Defense. This party and its adopted symbol went on to become the national organization of black militancy in the 1960s and 1970s, yet long-obscured is the crucial role that Lowndes County &#x201c;historically a bastion of white supremacy&#x201d; played in spurring black activists nationwide to fight for civil and human rights in new and more radical ways.<br>Drawing on an impressive array of sources ranging from government documents to personal interviews with Lowndes County residents and SNCC activists, Hasan Kwame Jeffries tells, for the first time, the remarkable full story of the Lowndes County freedom struggle and its contribution to the larger civil rights movement. Bridging the gaping hole in the literature between civil rights organizing and Black Power politics, Bloody Lowndes offers a new paradigm for understanding the civil rights movement.</p></p><p><b>Hasan Kwame Jeffries</b> is Associate Professor of History at The Ohio State University, where he holds a joint appointment at the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity."Without succumbing to the temptation to paint the struggle for black equality in broad strokes, Jeffries isolates the locus of the issues that framed the movement and uses these to explain how, through a variety of social networks, the movement spread regionally and ultimately nationally... is an exceptional piece of scholarship. Jeffries has produced an important work that will unquestionably reshape the debate over the origins and legacy of the civil rights and black power movements for years to come." (<i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br>"Bloody Lowndes is an important book. The authors careful analysis of the 1966 election is both readable and quite useful to understanding the importance of the moment." (<i>EverythingAlabama.com</i>)<br><br>"Jeffries' book sets a new standard for the political history of African Americans in the rural South by refocusing on the mechanics of power taken, used, lost, and retaken between blacks and whites, rather than the larger fabric of social and cultural politics. Given the stark and still unrelieved inequalities of the black belt, thisis a salutary stance." (Van Gosse <i>Journal of Southern History</i>)<br><br>"An extensively researched, well-written, and extremely important book that will make a tremendous contribution to the historiography of the Civil Rights and Black Power movements." (Emilye Crosby,author of A Little Taste of Freedom: The Black Freedom Struggle in Claiborne County, Mississippi)<br><br>"Jeffries is at the top of a very short list of &#x2018;young lions&#x2019; paving the way for a new interpretation of the history of the Civil Rights-Black Power movement. His work on the legendary Lowndes County Freedom Organization is outstanding in terms of the breadth and carefulness of research, depth and clarity of conceptualization, organization and presentation of material, and the originality and the wealth of the results." (Komozi Woodard,author of A Nation Within a Nation: Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones) and Black Power Politics)<br><br>"Jeffriess Bloody Lowndes is an important contribution to the literature of the African American freedom struggle. Jeffries reveals the deep historical roots of black struggles against racial and economic oppression in the Black Belt. He makes clear that the civil rights reforms of the 1960s were insufficient responses to the &amp; freedom politics that spawned the Lowndes County Freedom Organizationthe first Black Panther Party." (Clayborne Carson,author of In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s)<br><br>"Hasan Kwame Jeffries Bloody Lowndesprovides a nuanced portrait of the marriage between federal policy initiatives and local activism in the battle to dismantle Jim Crow, focusing on the months from March 1965 through November 1966 when SNCC workers, led by Stokely Carmichael, were active in Lowndes County, Alabama." (<i>American Studies</i>)<br><br>"Excellent scholarship, important history, and an invaluable contribution to understanding current and future conversations on race and politics in a dynamically changing political environment." (Charles V. Hamilton,co-author of Black Power: The Politics of Liberation)<br><br>"Jeffries examines the topic more thoroughly and in greater depth than any previous study, pressing the narrative back to Reconstruction but focusing most of his narrative and analysis on the mid-1960s and 1970s. The research is wide-ranging and in great depth, both in archival and oral history sources. . .this book is a needed and important addition to the historiography of the Civil Rights Movement." (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>"Jeffries has written the book historians of the black freedom movement have been waiting for. His beautifully written account rescues Lowndes County from its role as merely a backdrop to &amp; Black Power, to being one of the key battlegrounds for democracy in the United States. Here are local people whose local struggles have contributed mightily to the kind of politics we desperately need in the Obama agethe politics of &#x2018;freedom democracy,&#x2019; a politics born in Reconstruction, rooted in social justice and human rights, and honed in the Alabama cotton belt."

His memoir of what he found, <i>A Walk Across America</i>, captured the hearts of millions of Americans.</p><p>Now, Peter is a bit older, married with a family, and his journeys are different than they were. Perhaps he is looking for adventure, perhaps inspiration, perhaps new communities, perhaps unspoiled land. Certainly, he found all of this and more in Alaska, America's last wilderness.</p><p><i>Looking for Alaska</i> is Peter's account of eighteen months spent traveling over twenty thousand miles in tiny bush planes, on snow machines and snowshoes, in fishing boats and kayaks, on the Alaska Marine Highway and the Haul Road, searching for what defines Alaska. Hearing the amazing stories of many real Alaskans--from Barrow to Craig, Seward to Deering, and everywhere in between--Peter gets to know this place in the way that only he can. His resulting portrait is a rare and unforgettable depiction of a dangerous and beautiful land and all the people that call it home. </p><p>He also took his wife and eight-year-old daughter with him, settling into a "home base" in Seward on the Kenai Peninsula, coming and going from there, and hosting the rest of their family for extended visits. The way his family lived, how they made Alaska their home and even participated in Peter's explorations, is as much a part of this story as Peter's own travels.</p><p>All in all, Jenkins delivers a warm, funny, awe-inspiring, and memorable diary of discovery-both of this place that captures all of our imaginations, and of himself, all over again.</p></p><p>In 1999, Peter Jenkins and his family left their farm in Tennessee to live in Alaska for a few seasons, eventually renting a house in Seward, Alaska (pop. 2,830) on the Kenai Peninsula. The principal aim of the trip was for Jenkins to write a travelogue, but he also saw it as an opportunity to end a period of personal stagnation. It appears to have worked, for <i>Looking for Alaska</i> is filled with a vibrancy that can only come from one with a fully charged battery. Recognizing that "This giant place is filled with people determined to live as free as possible of others' intervention," he employed the same low-key approach to research that made his bestselling book <i>A Walk Across America</i> (1979) so engaging--he made friends wherever he went and allowed people to share their stories in their own way and in their own time. Part of Jenkins's charm is that he never pretends that he's figured the place out; he readily cops to his outsider status and invites readers to experience his sense of awe and surprise with him. During his 18-month stay in the Last Frontier, Jenkins spent time with wildlife rangers, recreation guides, native whalers, fishermen, and dogsled mushers, all of whom showed Jenkins and his family glimpses of their own private Alaska. (They also shared their bear stories; it seems nearly everyone in the state has had at least one run-in with the giant predator). "No one is ever the same after coming back from Alaska," he writes and after reading his book, it's easy to believe him. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i><p><b>Peter Jenkins</b>' 1979 written chronicle and photographs of his first journey, <i>A Walk Across America</i>, spent three months on <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller list.

With humor and verve, he covers an astonishing array of topics in the sciences and humanities, from the history of languages to how to simulate languages on computers to major ideas in the history of Western philosophy. <br>Through it all, Pinker presents a single, powerful idea: that language comprises a mental dictionary of memorized words and a mental grammar of creative rules. The idea extends beyond language and offers insight into the very nature of the human mind.<br>This is a sparkling, eye-opening, and utterly original book by one of the world's leading cognitive scientists.</p><p>Human languages are capable of expressing a literally endless number of different ideas. How do we manage it--so effortlessly that we scarcely ever stop to think about it? In <i>Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language</i>, a look at the simple concepts that we use to devise works as complex as love sonnets and tax laws, renowned neuroscientist and linguist Steven Pinker shows us how. The latest linguistic research suggests that each of us stores a limited (though large) number of words and word-parts in memory and manipulates them with a much smaller number of rules to produce every writing and utterance, and Pinker explains every step of the way with engaging good humor.<p> Pinker's enthusiasm for the subject infects the reader, particularly as he emphasizes the relation between how we communicate and how we think. What does it mean that a small child who has never heard the word <i>wug</i> can tell a researcher that when one wug meets another, there are two wugs? Some rule must be telling the child that English plurals end in -s, which also explains mistakes like <i>mouses</i>. Is our communication linked inextricably with our thinking? Pinker says yes, and it's hard to disagree. <i>Words and Rules</i> is an excellent introduction to and overview of current thinking about language, and will greatly reward the careful reader with new ways of thinking about how we think, talk, and write. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><blockquote><p>How does language work? How do we learn to speak? Why do languages change? Why do they have so many quirks? What does language reveal about the mind? </p></blockquote><p>Steven Pinker explores the mysteries of language in this original and hugely entertaining book. Pinker uses a deceptively simple phenomenon&#x2014;regular and irregular verbs&#x2014;to illuminate an astonishing array of topics: the history of languages, what we can learn from children's grammatical mistakes, the genetic and neurobiological underpinnings of language, and some of the major themes in Western philosophy. The key idea&#x2014;that language comprises a mental dictionary of memorized words and a mental grammar of creative rules&#x2014;extends beyond language, offering insight into the nature of thinking. For fans of <em>The Language Instinct</em> and <em>The Stuff of Thought</em>, here is another cornucopia of ideas about language and mind. </p></p><h2>Hebrews: An Exegetical and Theological Exposition of Holy Scripture (Volume 35) (The New American Commentary)</h2><p>&#x201c;For the word of God is living and active.

As there have been increases in violence against women, people of color, immigrants, and LGBTQI-identified people, there has been a corresponding demand for individual and community self-defense, boundary setting, and bystander trainings. Boundary setting can be used not just as a means for personal safety but as form of solidarity, resistance, and inspiration. <br><br>From saying no to a boss who always asks you to work late, to setting a boundary with a loved one, to navigating an uncomfortable situation at the bus stop, Cristien Storm offers a new approach to verbal boundary setting that is accessible for all bodies and identities. Practical in scope, the book includes tools, tips, and strategies from Storm's decades of experience leading boundary-setting workshops.

Most conservationists and environmentalists share this view. But what if the traditional view of ecology is wrong&#x2014;what if true environmentalists should be applauding the invaders? <br><br> In <i>The New Wild</i>, Pearce goes on a journey across six continents to rediscover what conservation in the twenty-first century should be about. Pearce explores ecosystems from remote Pacific islands to the United Kingdom, from San Francisco Bay to the Great Lakes, as he digs into questionable estimates of the cost of invader species and reveals the outdated intellectual sources of our ideas about the balance of nature. Pearce acknowledges that there are horror stories about alien species disrupting ecosystems, but most of the time, the tens of thousands of introduced species usually swiftly die out or settle down and become model eco-citizens. The case for keeping out alien species, he finds, looks increasingly flawed. <br><br> As Pearce argues, mainstream environmentalists are right that we need a rewilding of the earth, but they are wrong if they imagine that we can achieve that by reengineering ecosystems. Humans have changed the planet too much, and nature never goes backward. But a growing group of scientists is taking a fresh look at how species interact in the wild. According to these new ecologists, we should applaud the dynamism of alien species and the novel ecosystems they create. <br><br> In an era of climate change and widespread ecological damage, it is absolutely crucial that we find ways to help nature regenerate. Embracing the new ecology, Pearce shows us, is our best chance. To be an environmentalist in the twenty-first century means celebrating nature&#x2019;s wildness and capacity for change.</p><p><b>Fred Pearce</b> is an award-winning author and journalist based in London.

Nature&#x2019;s vagabonds, ruffians, and carpetbaggers are headed for an ecosystem near you. These biological adventurers are traveling the world in ever greater numbers, hitchhiking in our luggage, hidden in cargo holds, stuck to the bottom of ships, and migrating to keep up with climate change. Today&#x2019;s human-dominated world of globalized trade and messed-up ecosystems is giving footloose species many more chances to cruise the planet and set up home in distant lands. Some run riot, massacring local species, trashing their new habitats, and spreading diseases.</p><p>Most of us like a simple story with good guys and bad guys, and aliens always make easy enemies. So the threat of foreign species invading fragile environments and causing ecological mayhem gets our attention. Conservationists have for half a century been battling to hold back the tide of aliens. They call them the second biggest threat to nature, after habitat loss. Their concern is laudable. They want to protect native species and the ecosystems they inhabit. But do we fear these ecological outsiders too much? Most environmentalists would recoil to think this, but maybe our fear is sometimes little more than green xenophobia. Most of us are appalled when foreign humans are treated as somehow intrinsically dangerous. Yet the orthodoxy in conservation is to demonize foreign species in just that way. Native is good and alien is bad. But is this simple formula true? Or might we <i>need</i> the go-getter, can-do aliens? Might their success be a sign of nature&#x2019;s resilience in the face of the considerable damage humans have done to the planet?</p><p>I am an environmental journalist. Even to ask such questions gets me treated in some circles as a conservation heretic. I have met incredulity and hostility in equal measure. To be clear, I am not accusing environmentalists of being closet xenophobes or misanthropes, still less racists. But I have also found that I am far from alone in my concern that we have bought into some dangerous mythology about how nature works.</p><p>I am not questioning the motives&#x2014;to strengthen nature&#x2014;but the means. Many ecologists who actually study nature have told me that they feel conservationists are, with the best of intentions, getting the aliens wrong. And worse, that their efforts to keep out all foreign invaders of ecosystems might often be counterproductive, weakening nature rather than strengthening it. I have discovered that there is a scientific backlash against the simple formula that natives are good and aliens bad. The purpose of this book is to explore that new thinking and to ask what it should mean for conservation.</p><p>My conclusion is that mainstream conservationists are right that we need a rewilding of the Earth, but they are wrong if they imagine that we can achieve that by going backward. We need a new wild&#x2014;hence the title of this book. But the new wild will be very different from the old wild. We have changed our planet too much, and nature never goes backward. Nature&#x2019;s resilience is increasingly expressed in the strength and colonizing abilities of alien species. They are often the new natives. And in the new wild, we need to stand back and applaud.</p><p>There are horror stories about alien takeovers, of course. Most of those stories are set on small remote islands with only a few native species, where carnivorous rats, cats, and others hop off ships and cause mayhem. But elsewhere, most of the time, the tens of thousands of introduced species usually either swiftly die out or settle down and become model eco-citizens, pollinating crops, spreading seeds, controlling predators, and providing food and habitat for native species. They rarely eliminate natives. Rather than reducing biodiversity, the novel new worlds that result are usually richer in species than what went before. Even the &#x201c;terrorists&#x201d; of the conservation world, such as zebra mussels and tamarisk, Japanese knotweed and water hyacinth, often have a good side we rarely hear about.</p><p>After going on the trail of alien species across six continents, my conclusion is that their demonization says more about us and our fears of change than about them and their behavior. Some ardent wildlife lovers show a dark side when it comes to aliens. I sometimes think the more ardent they are, the more likely they are to be rabid about alien species. Understandable love of the local, the native, and the familiar&#x2014;of an imagined pristine environment before humans showed up&#x2014;too often becomes fear and hatred of the foreign and the unfamiliar.</p><p>This hostility is generally justified by outdated and ill-founded ideas about how nature works. We often think of life on Earth as made up of complex and tightly knit ecosystems like rainforests, wetlands, and coral reefs that are perfected and stable, with every species evolved to have a unique role. With that vision of nature, alien species are at best disruptive and at worst plain bad. But where did this idea come from? Darwin certainly never expressed it. He wrote that natural selection allowed species to adapt and survive, but he said nothing about ecosystems evolving to some sort of perfect state. They were just a jumble of species making their way in the world.</p><p>Today, fewer and fewer ecologists believe nature is either stable or perfectible. Real nature, they say, is often random, temporary, and constantly being remade by fire, flood, and disease&#x2014;with species coming and going, fitting in, adapting, or losing out. Change is the norm, they say. In this vision of nature, alien species are just like any others. Whether brought by humans or in more traditional ways, they are not an intrinsic threat to ecosystems. They are part of nature doing its thing, constantly reordering itself, constantly submitting to random events. Aliens may or may not cause change, but if change is the norm, then there is no harm in that. In any case, when invaded by foreign species, ecosystems don&#x2019;t collapse. Often they prosper better than before. The success of aliens becomes a sign of nature&#x2019;s dynamism, not its enfeeblement.</p><p>This new ecological thinking is critical for how we understand the meaning of conservation and for what actions we take in the name of protecting nature. If nature is perfected and vulnerable to outsiders, then conservationists have to line the barricades to keep out the interlopers and restore the balance of nature. That&#x2019;s what most conservationists think, and for a long time I shared that view. But if it is wrong, then keeping out aliens serves no obvious purpose. More than that, it may be counterproductive. Nature&#x2019;s desperados are proven colonists and exploiters of the ecological mess that humans leave behind them. So surely that makes them nature&#x2019;s best chance of healing the damage done by chain saws and plows, by pollution and climate change. Far from being nature&#x2019;s destroyers, aliens may be its reinvigorators, its salvation. They may be a sign that nature is not done. That it can bounce back. If that thinking is right, then simple conservation is shortsighted, and true environmentalists should be applauding the invaders.</p><p>I do not want to suggest that we should always welcome every alien species. We humans may sometimes want to protect the species we know and love&#x2014;in the habitats that we are familiar with. There is nothing wrong with that. And where alien species cause us inconvenience&#x2014;whether zebra mussels in American waterways, rats on oceanic islands, or rabbits in Australia&#x2014; we may want to try to halt their spread. Again, that is fair enough. We have a legitimate need to curb some of those excesses and a legitimate desire to protect what we like best. But we should be clear that when we do this, it is for ourselves and not for nature, whose needs are usually rather different.</p><p>While we seek to protect what we like in nature, we should remember something else. There is very little that is truly natural in nature anymore. There are very few, if any, pristine ecosystems to be preserved. Thanks to the activities of humans over thousands of years, no forests are virgin. They are all regenerating from past human invasions. We live in a new geological era, the Anthropocene, in which nothing is undisturbed and most ecosystems are a hodgepodge of native and alien species, often getting on in unexpected and productive ways.</p><p>Over my years as a journalist, I have written plenty of articles about how much harm alien species appear to do&#x2014;about killer algae, marauding water hyacinth, and many more. There was truth in them all, but they missed the bigger picture. This book is my journey to discover what conservation should really be about in the twenty-first century. It should not be about trying to preserve nature in aspic, still less about trying to recreate the past. That is both impossible and an affront to nature, like trying to turn the world into a giant zoo. In the twenty-first century, rather than fighting a losing battle to protect what we imagine to be pristine nature, we should be encouraging nature&#x2019;s rebirth, often through the dynamism and invasive instincts of its alien species.</p><p>Nature does not exist to do our bidding. While alien species may sometimes be a pain in the neck for human society, they are often exactly the shot in the arm that real nature needs. Conservationists who want to cosset nature like a delicate flower, to protect it from the threat of alien species, are the ethnic cleansers of nature, neutralizing the forces that they should be promoting. It is foolish to fear nature at its most dynamic&#x2014;red in tooth and claw, rhizome and spore, root and branch. As true environmentalists, we should rejoice when species burst through the paving stones of our cities or wash up on foreign shores. We should celebrate nature&#x2019;s powers of recovery. We should let it run wild. How else are species to thrive and respond to the disruption of our activities, including climate change, if not by invading new territories, by becoming aliens? True nature lovers should see that.</p><p>Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson, the guru of biodiversity and rainforests, said that the twenty-first century will be &#x201c;the era of restoration in ecology.&#x201d; I hope so. But we will not be going back to a supposedly pristine world. We cannot. We should be restoring nature&#x2019;s wildness, not trying to turn one moment in its past into an ossified museum relic. The new wild will be different but no less dramatic and wonderful than the old wild. Alien species, and the novel ecosystems they inhabit, will be at the heart of it. We should bring them on.</p></p><h2>The Unabbreviated Horologion or Book of the Hours: Brown Cover</h2><p>This book provides the basic &#34;skeleton&#34; for all the services of the Orthodox Church, into which variable texts from other sources are inserted.

John Ruskin, the famous art critic, didn&#39;t believe that ladies could paint before he met Lilias, he changed his mind after he met her, and believed that if she would give her life to painting she could become the greatest painter of the nineteenth century. Ruskin believed that if she would devote herself to art &#34;she would be the greatest living painter and do things that would be immortal. &#34; - he was unhappy that she was spending so much time on the streets of London, helping with the YWCA when he thought she ought to be painting. Lilias, however, decided to give up her career in art in order to serve God. She always remained a good friend of Ruskin&#39;s though, and they wrote many letters when she was in Algeria. She also wrote several books - beautifully illustrated by herself, including: Parables of the Cross (1894), Parables of the Christ-Life (1899), and a book for Sufi Muslims The Way of the Sevenfold Secret.</p><p></p><h2>Lions &amp; Liars</h2><p><p>Frederick Frederickson has a food-chain theory about life.

This book brings together an array of experts to provide the latest practical and evidence-based guidance to school speech-language pathologists.<br>School-Age Language Intervention shows that the research evidence continues to support the themes of the popular Contextualized Language Intervention: intervention within naturalistic, motivating communicative contexts, using the critical treatment elements of RISE (Repeated opportunities, Intensive schedule, Systematic support, Explicit skill focus).<br>School-age Language Intervention is organized into three sections:<br>Section 1: addresses the fundamentals of school SLP practice: who works on what; the ways treatment can be structured; and the rules of the road that govern special education and SLP services. This section explains evidence-based practice and helps students and clinicians make sense of the complicated world of research evidence. The best of skill-based and naturalistic intervention are combined in a RISE-based whole-part-whole framework. Academic standards, particularly the new Common Core State Standards, are used to link treatment to the classroom. This section ends with critical consideration of specific language impairment and reading disability that includes the latest brain research, and how second-language-learners fare in different instructional and treatment formats.<br>Section 2: details best practices for spoken and written language intervention. Chapters address how to effectively teach diverse and deep vocabulary knowledge, complex syntactic skills, and the narrative and informational discourse needed to understand and produce academic texts. A chapter is devoted to helping children at environmental risk to cope with the expectations of school.<br>Section 3: addresses the written code and the cognitive underpinnings of school success: phonological processing, word identification, reading fluency, and spelling. Language and print demands come together in a chapter addressing effective instruction for text comprehension. The book ends with the final frontier of supporting high school and college students who have reading difficulties.</p><p>Teresa Ukrainetz, Ph.D., S-LP(C), is professor and director of communication disorders at the University of Wyoming.

It is designed for both beginners and the experienced, covering the relatively easy spring males as well as the more difficult fall plumages. </p><p> When trying to identify birds it is important to remember the following motto: <i>I don't know.</i> </p><p> Really, it's okay to say it! Too many birders will get an inconclusive view of a bird and then just guess. With practice, you can identify birds from incredibly short glimpses of them, but there will always be some "I don't knows." And even if you do get a good look and still can't identify the warbler, you will have learned from the process. The next time you see that species, it will be familiar to you and you may see another field mark or behavior to help in its identification. And don't forget to watch the warblers as well! Keeping a checklist is fun and a way to record your sightings, but careful observations will help you really understand these interesting birds. Watching warblers in their environment reveals interactions that link all of nature together. </p></p><h2>Early Times: The Story of Ancient Rome, 2nd Edition</h2><p>In Virgil's epic poem <em>The Aeneid</em>, Rome was said to descend from a Trojan Prince, son of the goddess Venus.

Daring to speculate on a future beyond white supremacy, black utopian artists and thinkers offer powerful visions of ways of being that are built on radical concepts of justice and freedom. They imagine a new black citizen who would inhabit a world that soars above all existing notions of the possible.<br><br>In <i>Black Utopia</i>, Alex Zamalin offers a groundbreaking examination of African American visions of social transformation and their counterutopian counterparts. Considering figures associated with racial separatism, postracialism, anticolonialism, Pan-Africanism, and Afrofuturism, he argues that the black utopian tradition continues to challenge American political thought and culture. <i>Black Utopia</i> spans black nationalist visions of an ideal Africa, the fiction of W. E. B. Du Bois, and Sun Ra&#x2019;s cosmic mythology of alien abduction. Zamalin casts Samuel R. Delany and Octavia E. Butler as political theorists and reflects on the antiutopian challenges of George S. Schuyler and Richard Wright. Their thought proves that utopianism, rather than being politically immature or dangerous, can invigorate political imagination. Both an inspiring intellectual history and a critique of present power relations, this book suggests that, with democracy under siege across the globe, the black utopian tradition may be our best hope for combating injustice.</p><p>Alex Zamalin is assistant professor of political science and director of the African American Studies Program at University of Detroit Mercy. He is the author of <i>African American Political Thought and American Culture: The Nation&#x2019;s Struggle for Racial Justice</i> (2015); <i>Struggle on Their Minds: The Political Thought of African American Resistance</i> (Columbia, 2017); and <i>Antiracism: An Introduction</i> (2019).Covering considerable ground with unusual eloquence and depth, Alex Zamalin brilliantly elucidates the contours of a black utopian tradition that poses a forceful challenge to our contemporary modes of political theorizing. Like the utopias and dystopias it delineates, <i>Black Utopia </i>both inspires and unsettles the reader in critically productive ways. This is first-rate scholarship. (Simon Stow, John Marshall Professor of Government and American Studies, College of William and Mary)<br><br>Crisply written and compellingly argued, <i>Black Utopia</i> traces a remarkable genealogy of black utopian and anti-utopian thought from Martin Delany in the early nineteenth century to Octavia Butler in the early twenty-first. A versatile cultural historian and political theorist, Alex Zamalin reveals that the democratic hope for racial equality and social justice has historically overcome dystopian conditions, ranging from slavery to present-day racism, while animating the African American intellectual imagination. (Gene Andrew Jarrett, author of <i>Representing the Race: A New Political History of African American Literature</i>)<br><br>Alex Zamalin's focus in this engaging text is the underside of the more familiar modes of African American writing. From this hidden ground, he captures imaginative creations that have been fed by African American doubts, fears, and despair about democracy and racial equality in America. These creations have been both utopian and dystopian as opposed to strategic and reformist. Beginning with Martin Delany and concluding with Octavia Butler, <i>Black Utopia </i>is an exquisite introduction to this more hidden strain of African American thought. (Paget Henry, author of <i>Caliban&#x2019;s Reason: Introducing Afro-Caribbean Philosophy</i>)<br><br>Alex Zamalin balances generosity and critique in a careful yet energetic and buoyant manner.

The buoyant text jumps along as the old lady swallows a salmon, an otter, a seal, a walrus, and more, until eventually she swallows the entire sea and the trout swims free!

He has received a number of awards for his illustrations, including a Coretta Scott King Honor for <i>Running the Road to ABC</i>. He lives with his wife on Long Island, New York.</p>PreSchool-Grade 2-"There was an old lady who swallowed a trout that splished and splashed and thrashed about. It wanted out!" So begins this cumulative rhyme based upon the tried-and-true nonsense verse "I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly." Sloat's version has a Pacific Northwest setting; a salmon, otter, seal, porpoise, walrus, whale, and an ocean are also consumed. The verse concludes with the woman opening her mouth, freeing the ocean and the various creatures she has ingested. Ruffins's colorful illustrations reflect both the zaniness of the rhyme and the coastal locale. The fact that the old lady survives her gastronomical ordeal might play better with sensitive members of the preschool set than the original version in which she perishes after downing a horse. While trying to rhyme porpoise with purpose seems forced, the verse as a whole will sound quite lyrical if read aloud. Storytellers may want to pair this with Simms Taback's There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly (Viking, 1997), a strikingly fresh version of the old standby.<br><i>Tom S.

Early settlers sought out other natural resources as well, with limestone quarried from the Niagara Escarpment along Lake Michigan, iron mined in the Penokee Range, and copper discovered in glacial deposits, eroded from Midcontinental Rift basalts near Lake Superior. Not only is Wisconsin's geology some of the most diverse of any sate in the country, but much of it is internationally famous. Within the state's borders are enormous potholes eroded by glacial floods, a mysterious meteor impact site, caves with flowstone "painted" by iron and manganese oxides, and Van Hise Rock in the Barabooo Hills, where principles of structural geology were established.<br><br>Author Scott Spoolman has picked 52 of the best geologic sites in the state to include in Wisconsin Rocks!, a new title in the state-by-state Geology Rocks! series. Organized into five regions of the state, all of the sites are in publically accessible parks and natural areas. Outdoor enthusiasts will enjoy learning about the rock formations of the state's many glens, gorges, and bluffs. Geology buffs can also explore glacial features along Wisconsin's 1,200-mile-long Ice Age Trail or avoid them altogether in the Driftless Area, a region mysteriously untouched by the massive ice sheets of the Pleistocene Epoch.</p><p>Born and raised in northern Wisconsin, Scott Spoolman was fascinated with his native state&#39;s forests, waters, and rocks. His early experiences fed into a long career as a science writer. He obtained a masters degree in science journalism from the University of Minnesota and then worked for textbook publishing companies, including a stint as geology editor for McGraw-Hill, before starting a freelance writing business. He and his wife, Gail, who now live in Madison, raised two children, and as a family they explored the natural areas of Wisconsin and neighboring states.</p><h2>Stories from Shakespeare</h2><p>In <i>Stories from Shakespeare</i>, Marchette Chute opens wide the gateway to the most varied and glorious world ever created by one man. Her retellings of all thirty-six First Folio plays are superbly lucid. It is not Ms. Chute's purpose to provide a substitute for these immortal comedies, tragedies, and histories; rather she seeks to provide the modern reader with essential insight into Shakespeare's narrative genius, clarifying the intricacies of plot and sharply delineating a host of characters, major and minor alike. This she does with surpassing grace and unobtrusive scholarship, closely following the sequence of onstage action and illuminating it with choice quotations and perceptive comments. <i>The New Yorker</i> has termed this work "a beautifully done job."</p><p><b>Marchette Chute</b>&nbsp;(1909&#x2013;1994) was an American writer best known for her biographies of British literary giants, including <i>Geoffrey Chaucer of England</i>,&nbsp;<i>Shakespeare of London</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Ben Jonson of Westminster.&nbsp;</i>She was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and president of the PEN American Center.</p><h2>Teddy: The Remarkable Tale of a President, a Cartoonist, a Toymaker and a Bear</h2><p>The story goes that on a hunting trip in 1902, President Theodore ?Teddy? Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear. ?Me? Shoot that little fella?? he said. ?Why, if I so much as ruffled his fur, I'd never be able to look my children in the eyes again!? When a political cartoonist shared the story in the newspaper, New York shopkeepers Rosie and Morris Michtom were impressed by the president's big, warm heart. So they decided to create a ?Teddy? bear in his honor to sell in their store. The bear was so popular, they made another one. And another. Before they knew it, they had to build a factory to accommodate the demand: it seemed every child wanted a teddy bear of their own!<br><br>James Sage uses a playful blend of fact and fiction to tell this entertaining tale. The back matter includes a historical note, photos and a list of sources. The lively, fun narrative and vivid illustrations by Lisk Feng make for a wonderful read-aloud with universal appeal: adults will find it as charming as children do. The book has many applications in the social studies curriculum for the early grades, as the period and the president are brought vividly to life. And, of course, it's a perfect pick for Presidents' Day. The story also presents an inspiring small-business entrepreneurial success story.</p><p>James Sage is the author of over a dozen books for children, including Old Misery, Stop Feedin' da Boids!, Fat Cat and Mr. Beast. James is an American who has lived and traveled in many parts of the world, and now lives in Lincolnshire in the UK.<p>Lisk Feng is an award-winning illustrator of Everest and A Hug Is for Holding Me. Originally from China, she now works as a freelance illustrator in New York City.</p>PreS-Gr 2-Sage uses a mix of mainly fact and a bit of speculation to explain how teddy bears got their name and became such a popular toy. President Theodore Roosevelt, also referred to as Teddy or T.R., went hunting during a stay in Missouri, but was unable to shoot a bear. His hosts then found a cub, tied it to a tree, and encouraged him to take a shot. Feeling that it was not sportsmanlike, he declined. At this very time, the editor-in-chief of the Washington Post asked cartoonist Clifford Berryman to create a cartoon that would touch the heart and speak to everyone, and have it ready for the very next day. When a coffee boy told Berryman the story of T.R. that had just come over the newswire, Berryman stayed up creating a cartoon of a caring T.R. refusing to shoot the bear. The rest, as they say, is history. When Mr. and Mrs. Michtom, candy store owners in Brooklyn, saw the cartoon, Mrs. Michtom created a toy bear that her husband placed in the store window with a sign that said: "Teddy's Bear." The toy became so popular, they opened a factory to keep up with the demand. This story is told simply and is accompanied by colorful illustrations that reflect a bygone era.

The commentary focuses primarily on the Markan understanding of the Jesus traditions as reflected in this key New Testament book. For each section in Mark, the author analyzes how it fits the immediate and larger context of the Gospel; offers verse-by-verse comments on the words, phrases, sentences, and themes found in the section; and explores what Mark is seeking to teach.<br><br>As with all BECNT volumes, <i>Mark</i> features the author's detailed interaction with the Greek text. It combines academic sophistication with pastoral sensitivity and accessibility to serve as a useful tool for pastors, church leaders, students, and teachers.</p><p>"Robert H. Stein has composed an excellent commentary on Mark 1:1-16:8. He explains well the purpose and structure of the Gospel, discusses in detail its problematic verses, judiciously selects views of other commentators, and explains why he thinks the Gospel ends at 16:8. Hence Stein's commentary will be a precious <i>vade mecum </i>for pastors and preachers, students of the New Testament, and teachers in biblical studies."--<b>Joseph A. Fitzmyer, SJ</b>, professor emeritus, biblical studies, Catholic University of America, Washington, DC<br><br>"Bob Stein has written a great commentary on the Gospel of Mark. It is rich with interpretive insight, yet it is very reader friendly. Scholars, pastors, students, and lay readers will appreciate how Stein tackles difficult questions head-on and presents sensible solutions. Reading this commentary gives the reader a real sense of what the evangelist Mark was trying to say and how his original readers would have understood him. It makes an excellent contribution to the BECNT series."--<b>Craig A. Evans</b>, Payzant Distinguished Professor of New Testament, Acadia Divinity College, Nova Scotia<br><br>"This comprehensive commentary is the seasoned work of a first-rate, evangelical scholar. The discussions are well informed, and the positions taken are judicious and fair. Anyone working on the Second Gospel will find significant help here, particularly with regard to the theology and purpose of the evangelist."--<b>Klyne Snodgrass</b>, Paul W. Brandel Professor of New Testament Studies, North Park Theological Seminary, Chicago<b>Robert H. Stein</b> (PhD, Princeton Theological Seminary) was most recently senior professor of New Testament interpretation at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. He previously taught at Bethel Seminary. A world-renowned scholar of the Synoptic Gospels, Stein has published several books, including <i>Luke, A Basic Guide to Interpreting the Bible, Studying the Synoptic Gospels</i>, and <i>Jesus the Messiah</i>.</p><h2>The Intimate Mystery: Creating Strength and Beauty in Your Marriage (Intimate Marriage Series)</h2><p>What do you want out of your marriage? Do you simply want to get along and be happy? Or do you desire real intimacy--the kind of relationship that will challenge you to grow as an individual and satisfy you in a much deeper way than you have imagined? Contrary to what television and bridal magazines tell us, marriage is about much more than personal happiness. Marriage is about spiritual growth. God wants to use your marriage to shape your character and to carry out his purposes in the world through you as a couple. The book of Genesis provides a matrix for understanding the intimate mystery of marriage in light of three commands--leave (your family of origin), weave (a life together) and cleave (through sexual intimacy). In this book, Dan Allender and Tremper Longman III explore and unpack the rich implications of this pattern. While this paper edition can be read on its own, a couple, Bible study group or Sunday school class can enhance their understanding by making their way through the bonus six Bible study sessions included in this expanded edition. Video segments introducing each of the Bible study sessions are also available online for free video download, making this book a complete small group curriculum. <em>The Intimate Mystery</em> is part of the <em>Intimate Marriage Curriculum Kit</em> which includes everything needed to mentor individual married couples or to lead a group discussion and makes an especially helpful resource for newlyweds or young married couples.</p><p>Author Interview <p>Dan Allender &amp; Tremper Longman, authors of The Intimate Mystery</p>IVP: How is this book and curriculum different than others on marriage? <p>Longman: We felt that Christians need more than another how-to, step-by-step book. Rather, we thought it would be more helpful to get people in touch with important biblical ideas about the nature of marriage. The Bible tells us everything we need to know about marriage--its purpose and goal, and its importance. We also learn important principles about the most essential aspects of marriage such as communication, sexuality, and most importantly, about repentance and forgiveness. IVP: What do you mean by the "intimate mystery" of marriage? </p><p>Allender: One the mysteries of marriage is sacrifice. "Sacrifice is not merely cleaning the floor or doing the laundry; it is suffering for, with and against the other without turning away from desire. Sacrifice compels us to enter the heartache, stories, dreams, desires and sin of the other in order to bless them. It calls us to lose ourselves in the complex web of their soul. The mystery is great--in doing so, we find ourselves. We find our truest self and the God who is true to our self. The sacrifices of love open our eyes to the mystery of Jesus' death and resurrection for us."</p></p><h2>The Roman Empire and the New Testament: An Essential Guide</h2><p><p>An indispensable introduction to Roman society, culture, law, politics, religion, and daily life as they relate to the study of the New Testament.<br>The Roman Empire formed the central context in which the New Testament was written. Anyone who wishes to understand the New Testament texts must become familiar with the political, economic, societal, cultural, and religious aspects of Roman rule. Much of the New Testament deals with enabling its readers to negotiate, in an array of different manners, this pervasive imperial context. This book will help the reader see how social structures and daily practices in the Roman world illumine so much of the content of the New Testament message. For example, to grasp what Paul was saying about food offered to idols one must understand that temples in the Roman world were not &#x201c;churches,&#x201d; and that they functioned as political, economic, and gastronomic centers, whose religious dealings were embedded within these other functions.Brief in presentation yet broad in scope,&nbsp;<em>The Roman Empire and&nbsp;the New Testament: An Essential Guide</em>&nbsp;will introduce students to the information and ideas essential to coming to grips with the world in which early Christianity was born.</p></p><p>Warren Carter is Professor of New Testament at Brite Divinity School in Fort Worth, with a Ph.D. from Princeton Theological Seminary.

In addition, the book will help upgrade students' mathematical skills as they learn the fundamentals of fluid mechanics.<br>The text presents a unified method of analysis that poses fluid mechanics problems in precise mathematical language without becoming stiff or unnecessarily rigorous. This method involves three steps: First, the text carefully defines each problem so the student knows what is given and what is missing. Second, each chapter treats the physical aspects of the problems so the student can visualize how things work in the real world. Third, the text represents the physical model by appropriate mathematical symbols and operators, collects these into equations, and then solves them. The result is a superb learning and teaching process that covers everything the engineer needs to know &#x2014; nature of fluids, hydrostatics, differential and integral equations, dimensional analysis, viscous flows, and other topics &#x2014; while allowing students to see each element in its relation to the whole.<br>Each chapter contains numerous examples incorporating problem-solving techniques, demonstrations to illustrate topical material, study questions, boxed equations of significant results, appropriate references to supplementary materials and other study aids. Over 760 illustrations enhance the text. This volume will be an indispensable reference and resource for any student of fluid mechanics or practicing engineer. </p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Galois Theory: Lectures Delivered at the University of Notre Dame by Emil Artin (Notre Dame Mathematical Lectures, Number 2)</h2><p><p>In the nineteenth century, French mathematician Evariste Galois developed the Galois theory of groups-one of the most penetrating concepts in modem mathematics.

Milgram, who has also supplemented the work with a Section on Applications.<br>The first section deals with linear algebra, including fields, vector spaces, homogeneous linear equations, determinants, and other topics. A second section considers extension fields, polynomials, algebraic elements, splitting fields, group characters, normal extensions, roots of unity, Noether equations, Jummer's fields, and more.<br>Dr. Milgram's section on applications discusses solvable groups, permutation groups, solution of equations by radicals, and other concepts.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>To Kill a People: Genocide in the Twentieth Century</h2><p>There have been numerous books on genocide in the last twenty years, but <em>To Kill a People </em>offers a different approach. It is one of the few books on genocide expressly written for use in the college classroom. The book includes four case studies--the Armenian, Nazi, Cambodian, and Rwandan genocides--and substantive introductory and concluding chapters that contribute to two key debates within genocide studies: how to define "genocide" and place it in relation to other mass atrocities, and how to detect and analyze the social, historical, and cultural forces that produce genocidal violence.<br><br><em>To Kill a People</em> examines a vast range of the latest research, offers original interpretations and arguments, and draws upon the author's own archival research on three continents. The case studies are supplemented by primary readings and thought-provoking questions, and the book concludes with a chapter that synthesizes the lessons and issues that arise from the study of genocide. A chapter-length bibliographic essay further distinguishes this book and will be useful to students and experts alike.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Cox </strong>is Associate Professor of International Studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where he directs the Center for Holocaust, Genocide, and Human Rights Studies.

Cogently structured and elegantly written, it combines an expert grasp of the causes and dynamics of genocide with an impressive command of the scholarly literature. It is also distinguished by a humane critical perspective, founded on a conviction that genocide is not an inevitable or necessarily eternal feature of human affairs. This galvanizing work will long be read, studied, and appreciated by students and other concerned citizens."--Adam Jones, author of <em>The Scourge of Genocide: Essays</em> <em>and Reflections and Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction</em> <br><p></p><br>"Cox effectively combines case studies of four of the most devastating mass exterminations of the twentieth century with much needed conceptual and background discussions that raise key overarching questions."--Thomas Pegelow-Kaplan, Director, <em>Appalachian State Center for Judaic, Holocaust, and</em> <em>Peace Studies</em> <br><p></p><br>"Cox offers fresh perspectives on the meaning and significance of the term genocide. <em>To Kill a People</em> will add significantly to our ongoing study of this topic."--David M. Crowe, author of <em>War Crimes, Genocide, and Justice: A Global History</em> <br><p></p><br>"I cannot recommend any textbook more highly than <em>To Kill a People</em>. It is lucid, compact, and jargon-free. While it is copiously erudite (the author seems to have read and digested every secondary source on the topic), the scholarly apparatus of footnotes, a bibliographical essay and film list, excerpts from primary sources after each chapter and associated discussion questions, and a genocide time-line does not at all clutter the central argument and its subsidiary themes. Students and instructors alike will not only be drawn to this text due to its accessibility; they will also find the moral ardor of Cox's prose winsome and compelling."--Michael S.

It is not just about emigrants and refugees. It is about us all.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The New York Times <br></i><br> When her parents brought her from the war-ravaged, faded elegance of her native Cracow in 1959 to settle in well-manicured, suburban Vancouver, Eva Hoffman was thirteen years old. Entering into adolescence, she endured the painful pull of nostalgia and struggled to express herself in a strange unyielding new language. &nbsp;<br><br> Her spiritual and intellectual odyssey continued in college and led her ultimately to New York&#x2019;s literary world yet still she felt caught between two languages, two cultures. But her perspective also made her a keen observer of an America in the flux of change. <br><br>A classically American chronicle of upward mobility and assimilation. <i>Lost in Translation</i> is also an incisive meditation on coming to terms with one&#x2019;s own uniqueness, on learning how deeply culture affects the mind and body, and finally, on what it means to accomplish a translation of one&#x2019;s self. <br><br> &#x201c;Hoffman raises one provocative question after another about the relationship between language and culture . . . and about the emotional cost of re-creating oneself.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Newsday </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>The condition of exile is an exaggeration of the process of change and loss that many people experience as they grow and mature, leaving behind the innocence of childhood. Eva Hoffman spent her early years in Cracow, among family friends who, like her parents, had escaped the Holocaust and were skeptical of the newly imposed Communist state. Hoffman's parents managed to immigrate to Canada in the 1950s, where Eva was old enough to feel like a stranger--bland food, a quieter life, and schoolmates who hardly knew where Poland was. Still, there were neighbors who knew something of Old World ways, and a piano teacher who was classically Middle European in his neurotic enthusiasm for music. Her true exile came in college in Texas, where she found herself among people who were frightened by and hostile to her foreignness. Later, at Harvard, Hoffman found herself initially alienated by her burgeoning intellectualism; her parents found it difficult to comprehend. Her sense of perpetual otherness was extended by encounters with childhood friends who had escaped Cracow to grow up in Israel, rather than Canada or the United States, and were preoccupied with soldiers, not scholars. <i>Lost in Translation</i> is a moving memoir that takes the specific experience of the exile and humanizes it to such a degree that it becomes relevant to the lives of a wider group of readers.<b>Eva Hoffman&nbsp;</b>was born in Krakow, Poland, and emigrated to America in her teens. She is the author of&nbsp;<i>Lost in Translation, Exit Into History, Shtetl, The Secret</i>, and&nbsp;<i>After Such Knowledge. </i>She is&nbsp;the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Whiting Award, and an award from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.

In "The God Gene, Dr. Dean Hamer reveals that this inclination toward religious faith is no accident; it is in good measure due to our genes. In fact, he argues, spiritual belief may offer an evolutionary advantage by providing humans with a sense of purpose and the courage and will to overcome hardship and loss. And, as a growing body of evidence suggests, belief also increases our chances of reproductive survival by helping to reduce stress, prevent disease, and extend life. <br>Hamer shows that new discoveries in behavioral genetics and neurobiology indicate that humans inherit a set of predispositions that make their brains ready and eager to embrace a higher power. By analyzing the genetic makeup of over a thousand people of different ages and backgrounds, and comparing their DNA samples against a scale that measures spirituality, Hamer actually identified a specific "God gene" that appears to influence spirituality.<br>Popular science at its best, "The God Gene is an in-depth, fully accessible inquiry into the cutting-edge research that is changing the way we think about ourselves, our world, and our culture.

With an academic career that spanned from Cambridge to Harvard, Whitehead wrote extensively on mathematics, metaphysis, and philosophy. He died in Massachusetts in 1947.</p><h2>Clockwork Lives: The Graphic Novel</h2><p><b><i>Some lives can be summed up in a sentence or two. Other lives are epics.</i></b><br><br>Marinda Peake is a woman with a quiet, perfect life in a small village; she long ago gave up on her dreams and ambitions in order to take care of her ailing father, an alchemist and inventor. When he dies, he gives Marinda a mysterious gift: a blank book that she must fill with other people&#x2019;s stories&#x2014;and ultimately her own.<br> <br> <i>Clockwork Lives</i>&nbsp;is a steampunk Canterbury Tales&#x2014;and much more&#x2014;that follows Marinda as she strives to change her life from a &#x201c;mere sentence or two&#x201d; to a true epic.&nbsp;<br> <br> Based on the world they previously introduced in <i>Clockwork Angels</i>, Kevin J. Anderson and Neil Peart take the graphic novel to new heights with this adaptation of the best-selling book&nbsp;<i>Clockwork Lives</i>.</p><p>Vic Malhotra is a Canadian comic book artist. He is the co-creator/artist of the science fiction comic book Roche Limit published by Image Comics. He illustrated the comic book adaptions of the Joe Hill novella Thumbprint and the Jim Thompson novel The Killer Inside Me, as well as various The X-Files&#x2013;related comic books for IDW Publishing.Now here&#x2019;s a high-concept idea: a novel based on the new album by Rush, the popular rock band. Writer Anderson and Peart, Rush&#x2019;s drummer and lyricist, have been friends for more than two decades. Anderson takes the themes of Rush&#x2019;s songs and turns them into a very entertaining, elegantly written story of a boy on the cusp of manhood, living in a seemingly perfect society (thanks to &#x201c;our loving Watchmaker,&#x201d; who controls, well, everything). The boy discovers that some dark truths lurk just beneath his world&#x2019;s perfect surface. Firmly planted in the steampunk subgenre, the book tells an epic-scale story, following young Owen Hardy as he leaves the village of his birth, travels to the legendary Crown City, and gets caught up in an adventure that shows him a world he never knew existed. Syme, who&#x2019;s designed album covers for many bands, including Rush, contributes several beautiful illustrations that capture the dark undercurrent of Anderson&#x2019;s story. This is a fine piece of dystopian fiction, and it will appeal to readers young and old. --David Pitt</p><h2>The Long-Legged House</h2><p>First published in 1969 and out of print for more than twenty-five years, <i>The Long-Legged House</i> was Wendell Berry's first collection of essays, the inaugural work introducing many of the central issues that have occupied him over the course of his career.

He oversaw the preparation of meals for several Cardinals and was such a master of his profession that he became the personal cook for two Popes. At the culmination of his prolific career he compiled the largest cookery treatise of the period to instruct an apprentice on the full craft of fine cuisine, its methods, ingredients, and recipes.

Chilton exposes the root cause of a host of seemingly disparate diseases, such as arthritis, heart disease, obesity, eczema, lupus, Alzheimer's, and emphysema: unbridled inflammation. The average American diet (even when we're making what we think are healthy choices) is inflaming our immune systems. But with Dr. Chilton's revolutionary, all-natural dietary program, you can learn how to <i>choose foods that will help prevent, treat, and reverse the effects of this secret epidemic in as few as seven days.</i><br> <br>The Chilton Program includes:<br> -Easy-to-follow meal plans developed in collaboration with a world-class medical school<br> -A new food pyramid that charts which foods you should enjoy or avoid<br> -The Inflammation Index, which gives you the inflammatory potential of more than 250 foods<br> <br>Backed by twenty years of research, and by an unprecedented six clinical trials, Dr. Chilton's anti-inflammatory regimen is a must-have for the nearly 100 million Americans diagnosed with an inflammatory disorder and for the rest of us who must protect ourselves from this growing health crisis.</p><p><b>Floyd H. "Ski" Chilton, Ph.D.,</b> has served on the faculty of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the Wake Forest University School of Medicine, where he is a professor of physiology and pharmacology. He has authored more than 110 articles and textbook chapters, and holds thirty-two issued and seventeen pending patents. He lives in Winston-Salem, N.C., and is the father of four children.<br><br><b>Laura Tucker</b> is the coauthor of several health and medical books.<b>Introduction</b><p>A silent plague is sweeping America, and the vast majority of us are at risk. It has taken the form of a statistically significant and incalculably devastating series of epidemics -- an "epidemic of epidemics."</p><p>I believe this plague is largely preventable, and yet we are doing little to stop its spread. On the contrary, we're actually encouraging a tidal wave of disease. At best, these illnesses compromise our quality of life; at worst, they can be painful, debilitating, and fatal.</p><p>Consider the following:</p><p></p><blockquote><b>� Seventy million Americans suffer from arthritis -- or <i>one in every three adults.</i> That's <i>twice</i> as many arthritis sufferers as there were two decades ago.<p>� More than 20 million Americans have asthma today. It is the <i>sixth</i> most common chronic human disease.</p><p>� More than 50 million Americans suffer every year from allergies, a number that has doubled in the past twenty years. There has been a 100 percent increase in the prevalence of hay fever in developed countries in each of the last three decades. Allergic dermatitis affects us at <i>triple</i> the rate in 1960. Ten percent of our young children are affected by allergic dermatitis.</p><p>� There were 18.2 million people in the United States with diabetes in 2002, a 49 percent increase from ten years ago. This debilitating disease contributes to about two hundred thousand deaths in the United States each year.</p><p>� Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer of Americans. Almost <i>64 million</i> Americans have it in some form, and it killed almost a million people in 2001.</p><p>� Eczema is the most common skin condition in children under eleven; an estimated 15 million people in the United States suffer from the symptoms of this disease.</p></b><p><b>� One million Americans have inflammatory bowel disease.</b></p></blockquote><p>Anyone would agree that these numbers are overwhelming. But they're even more devastating when you realize that this isn't just a random laundry list of conditions. In fact, these diseases all share a single underlying cause.</p><p>What's the common denominator linking these seemingly disparate diseases, and other serious ones, including lupus, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis? The answer comes from a surprising quarter: the body's own self-defense system. These are all <i>inflammatory diseases,</i> diseases that occur when the body's own defense system turns against itself.</p><p>And our bodies are turning against themselves in record numbers. Each one of these diseases, taken individually, represents a serious health problem in this country. Taken together, as a category of diseases, this can only be seen as a pandemic. It is true that some of these diseases overlap, like allergies and asthma, which makes it difficult to make an accurate estimate of the full scope of the inflammatory disease problem in this country. But even with that overlap, I don't think I'm overstating the problem when I say that inflammatory diseases affect as many as half of the people in this country.</p><p><b></b></p><b>The Inflammatory Cluster</b><p>You're probably familiar, from the news and movies like <i>Erin Brockovich,</i> with the phenomenon called the "cancer cluster," when people in a community or a profession develop related types of cancer in disproportionately high percentages. It's an absolutely terrifying occurrence.</p><p>When a cluster is identified, researchers immediately look for a proximate cause, a cancer-inducing agent to which every one of the patients has been exposed. When that proximate cause is uncovered (a factory dumping toxic chemicals into the groundwater, for example), the rest of us thank our lucky stars that it didn't happen in <i>our</i> neighborhood.</p><p>When I began my research into the connection between diet and inflammatory disease, I was simply searching for something to help people who suffered from advanced and chronic inflammatory disease. I wanted to find a natural, dietary solution that would alleviate symptoms in people who had otherwise exhausted their options. But I came to realize, as I hope you will over the course of this book, that the problem of inflammatory disease was much, much bigger than I had thought -- and the stakes much higher as a result.</p><p>In fact, the soaring rise in inflammatory disease in this country is nothing less than a cluster in its own right. It's a nationwide cluster, a cluster without walls, unbounded by the typical limits of geography or demographics. You <i>can't</i> breathe a sigh of relief that you live outside the radius of the toxic-waste spill, because there is no "outside." There is no localized danger zone, no limited area that can be cordoned off and sanitized.</p><p>It is when we begin to look for the proximate cause of this tremendous, nationwide epidemic that the terrible gravity of the situation hits home: the answer may in fact be right on our dinner plates. I believe that a major component driving these diseases is our diet, and the "toxic-waste spill," to continue the metaphor, is <i>our very food supply.</i> There is no safe house, no place to hide, unless we fundamentally change the way we eat, in the ways prescribed in this book.</p><p>This disaster has sneaked up on us, but not overnight: the circumstances leading up to it have been brewing for a century or more. The staggering number of Americans suffering from these painful and debilitating diseases are, horribly, acting as the canaries in the coal mine. Their agony is sending a message, loud and clear, to those of us who have so far managed to dodge the bullet. This book isn't about the division between people who have inflammatory disease and people who don't. It's not about "who has it" and "who doesn't"; instead it's about "who doesn't" and "who <i>will?"</i> Every single one of us has pulled a chair up to this contaminated trough -- which means that <i>every single one of us</i> is at risk.</p><p><b></b></p><b>"Why Haven't I Heard About This?"</b><p>You're probably wondering: if out-of-control inflammation is a silent plague threatening all of us, and not just a rare and exotic condition that affects the unfortunate few, why don't I know about it?</p><p>In fact, you know more about inflammation than you think. Like oxygen, inflammation is essential to our continued survival. When the inflammation system goes off course, we quickly turn to medication; I'd bet that there isn't a soul among us who doesn't have a bottle of aspirin in the medicine cabinet. This wonder drug quiets pain, soothes fever, and reduces swelling, like several of the other very effective anti-inflammatory drugs on the market.</p><p>Sometimes, however, our system becomes chronically inflamed. <i>Why</i> this happens is a puzzle. But we've been gathering the pieces of this puzzle for a while. Pharmaceutical companies have played an important role in uncovering the mysteries of how the inflammation system works. In fact, I like to refer to the inflammatory pathway that is the subject of this book as "the billion-dollar pathway," because it has absorbed more time and research -- and research dollars -- than almost any other area of medicine in the last thirty years. Soon, you will know it by another name: the AA Pathway (more about this later). The ability to block the AA Pathway is the magic behindblockbuster drugs like Celebrex and Singulair, as well as aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The AA Pathway is also the magic behind the Chilton Program, a whole new all-natural way of thinking about inflammation.</p><p><b></b></p><b>Why the Stakes Are So High Right Now</b><p>The shockingly high number of people who have been diagnosed with inflammatory disease is one reason that we must come to terms with this plague. The fact that every single one of us is potentially in the line of fire is another. But out-of-control inflammation looms large as a public health issue for a variety of other reasons as well:</p><p></p><blockquote><b>� Inflammatory diseases are debilitating and, in many cases, fatal. And there is no cure for these diseases. Although in most cases, we've gotten better at treating their symptoms, treatment often means expensive, long-term medications with side effects that can be as damaging as the diseases themselves, and even the best medications don't work all the time, or for everybody.<p>� More diseases have inflammation at their root than we think. Inflammation, it turns out, is the culprit behind many of the life-threatening conditions we thought were closed cases. For instance, ten years ago, cardiologists thought elevated blood lipids like cholesterol and triglycerides were the primary cause of heart disease, so we categorized atherosclerosis as a lipid-storage disease. Now we believe that heart disease, the leading killer of Americans, actually has inflammation at its root. And new research shows that underlying inflammation may be linked to other major killers, like Alzheimer's and certain types of cancer.</p><p>� Other human conditions have a significant inflammatory component. Even conditions that aren't strictly categorized as inflammatory diseases frequently have a significant inflammatory component, which is often the root of chronic pain and deforming tissue damage. For example, inflammation is a major driving force behind type 2 diabetes and dementia. In fact, inflammation may play a major role in the category of ailments and diseases we have previously called "aging." Consequently, treating and preventing inflammation can mean a tremendous boon for all of us, often resulting in an enormous increase in function and great relief from pain.</p><p>� Inflammation isn't the only burgeoning epidemic. Approximately 64 percent of Americans are overweight or obese. Not only does being overweight exacerbate an existing inflammatory disease, but fat cells play a major role in the creation of the messengers that cause inflammatory disease.</p><p>� More and more people are affected every year. Today's inflammatory disease statistics are alarming. Tomorrow's numbers will be worse. The number of people suffering from these diseases...</p></b></blockquote></p><h2>Falling for Rapunzel</h2><p>"The course of true love never did run smooth." --William Shakespeare<br><br>When the prince spies Rapunzel high in her tower, he's convinced she is the girl of his dreams. Of course he thinks he can save her the traditional way, but this is no traditional Rapunzel.<br><br>She throws down everything but what the princ asks for--including a surprise that makes all his dreams come true. <br><br>A hilarious fractured fairy tale with clever page-turns and vibrant, eclectic art that is perfect for funny Valentine's Day story hours.</p><p>Born in Surrey, England, <b>Lydia Monks</b> currently resides in London with her two cats.Kindergarten-Grade 4-This humorous twist on a traditional tale will resonate with today's young readers. Told in rhyming couplets, this version features a protagonist who weeps, not from loneliness, but rather over the sorry state of her flowing blond locks. The prince, mistaking her tears for legitimate suffering, is determined to set her free and invites her to throw down her hair. Rapunzel, however, mishears his request and throws down her underwear instead. The persistent noble tries a variety of other tactics, asking for her locks, tresses, rope, twine, and ladder, each time growing less enamored as she responds with socks, dresses, a cantaloupe, a swine, and a bowl of pancake batter. Finally, he begs her to let down her braid, but instead out drops her maid, a fortuitous mistake since the servant and the prince fall madly in love and ride off together. The verses are clever and concise, and the rhyming pattern allows listeners to anticipate their endings and to giggle over the results. The rhythm is consistent and the stresses in each line flow naturally, inspiring would-be poets. Monks's delightful acrylic-and-collage illustrations add to the humor. Their bright, vivacious colors, bold patterns, fun background details (e.g., skyscrapers, airplanes, and a computer in Rapunzel's tower), and exaggerated facial expressions reinforce the silliness. Pair this with David Wiesner's The Three Pigs (Clarion, 2001) and Diane Stanley's Goldie and the Three Bears (HarperCollins, 2003) for a fresh look at classic fairy tales.<br><i>Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI</i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At times we feel irked, exasperated, irritated, resentful, even enraged. Anger is a normal and healthy human emotion; learning to acknowledge and express it appropriately, however, especially for those in early recovery, is another story. Of Course You're Angry, first published in 1985, is a timely revision of the best-selling Hazelden title on the nature and resolution of anger, it shows us how to make anger work in a positive and effective way that can ease, rather than exacerbate, the problems and challenges of early recovery.In a friendly, nonconfrontive manner, Of Course You're Angry guides readers to discover the source of their anger and the forms it takes -- such as violence, depression, resentment, and manipulation. Authors Gayle Rosellini and Mark Worden continue by exploring various anger styles, and then provide clear, sensible, and practical guidelines for expressing anger, conquering "common conceits," and "wrangling with rancor." Their real-life examples and down-to-earth advice for dealing with anger without fear or guilt -- and without hurting oneself or others -- offers addicts as well as their family members and friends a way passed one of the most dangerous pitfalls of early recovery.</p><p>Gayle Rosellini has worked and published widely in the field of chemical dependency.</p><h2>No B.S.

But calling it a mistake is a generous rewriting of the history of greed, corruption, and indifference that pushed the US into consuming more than 80 percent of the world's opioid painkillers.<br>Journeying through lives and communities wrecked by the epidemic, Chris McGreal reveals not only how Big Pharma hooked Americans on powerfully addictive drugs, but the corrupting of medicine and public institutions that let the opioid makers get away with it.<br>The starting point for McGreal's deeply reported investigation is the miners promised that opioid painkillers would restore their wrecked bodies, but who became targets of "drug dealers in white coats."<br>A few heroic physicians warned of impending disaster. But <i>American Overdose</i> exposes the powerful forces they were up against, including the pharmaceutical industry's coopting of the Food and Drug Administration and Congress in the drive to push painkillers--resulting in the resurgence of heroin cartels in the American heartland. McGreal tells the story, in terms both broad and intimate, of people hit by a catastrophe they never saw coming. Years in the making, its ruinous consequences will stretch years into the future.</p><p><b>Chris McGreal</b> is a reporter for the <i>Guardian</i> and former journalist at the BBC. He was the Guardian's correspondent in Johannesburg, Jerusalem and Washington DC, and now writes from across the United States.<br><br> He has won several awards including for his reporting of the genocide in Rwanda, coverage of Israel/Palestine, and for writing on the impact of economic recession in modern America. He received the James Cameron prize for "work as a journalist that has combined moral vision and professional integrity". He was awarded the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism for reporting that "penetrated the established version of events and told an unpalatable truth".<br><br> He is a former merchant seaman.<i>"American Overdose</i><i> </i>confirms Chris McGreal's stature as one of the truly essential reporters of our times. It is - in its investigative depth and documentary breadth - a riveting and urgent reckoning of colossal corruption that has taken such a staggering toll on twenty-first century American life."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><b>Philip Gourevitch</b>, author of <i>We Wish To Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families</i></i></b><br><br>"In this gripping account, McGreal exposes the avarice and corruption that caused one of the most shocking crises in American history. A searing expose full of extraordinary characters - heroes, villains and victims."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Katty Kay</b>, contributor <i>MSNBC Morning Joe</i>, presenter <i>BBC World News America</i></i></b><br><br>"McGreal shows how the overdose crisis was driven by the pursuit of profits, not just drugs-both of which combine our instinctive craving for pleasure with our evolving capacity for denial and deceit.

Zola-esque in its dark twists and turns."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Ed Vulliamy</b>, <i>Literary Review</i></i></b></p><h2>The Picture of Dorian Gray - Literary Touchstone</h2><p>This Prestwick House Literary Touchstone Edition&#x2122; includes a glossary and reader&#x2019;s notes to help the modern reader contend with Wilde&#x2019;s many allusions and his complex approach to the human condition. Oscar Wilde&#x2019;s only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, first appeared in 1891. Dorian Gray, a handsome young man, falls in with a group of &#x201c;friends,&#x201d; whose amoral philosophies he finds quite appealing. After he has his portrait painted, his frivolity and general demeanor degenerate into wickedness, but only the portrait bears the effects of his descent into decadence and serves as a powerful symbol of Gray&#x2019;s internal ruin. Dorian himself, however, remains as young and unspoiled as the day he first sat for the painting. Wilde&#x2019;s exploration of life without limits or consequences shocked its late-Victorian audience and remains highly un- settling to modern readers. We, like Dorian, are forced to reconsider whether total freedom and absolute knowledge are really worth their costs.</p><p>A lush, cautionary tale of a life of vileness and deception or a loving portrait of the aesthetic impulse run rampant? Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, "as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife," Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. "The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden." <p> As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful "When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy." But despite its many languorous pleasures, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least "no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style." Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: "All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment."</p>This book is perfect for AP classes and is often selected for inclusion on the AP exam.

Dr. Wynkoop deals authoritatively with the critical issues, and incisively cuts through the prevalent fuzzy theological concepts, but all with delicacy and understanding. The monumental contribution of John Wesley in defining the doctrine of sanctification is a key emphasis in the book, along with the central issue of Christian assurance.

She also served as a professor at Nazarene Theological Seminary for several years. Her most well-known work, A Theology of Love: The Dynamic of Wesleyanism continues to play an important part in the Wesleyan-holiness tradition. She also wrote Foundations of Wesleyan-Arminian Theology.</p><h2>All They Will Call You (Camino del Sol)</h2><p><p><i>All They Will Call You </i>is the harrowing account of &#x201c;the worst airplane disaster in California&#x2019;s history,&#x201d; which claimed the lives of thirty-two passengers, including twenty-eight Mexican citizens&#x2014;farmworkers who were being deported by the U.S. government. Outraged that media reports omitted only the names of the Mexican passengers, American folk icon Woody Guthrie penned a poem that went on to become one of the most important protest songs of the twentieth century, &#x201c;Plane Wreck at Los Gatos (Deportee).&#x201d; It was an attempt to restore the dignity of the anonymous lives whose unidentified remains were buried in an unmarked mass grave in California&#x2019;s Central Valley. For nearly seven decades, the song&#x2019;s message would be carried on by the greatest artists of our time, including Pete Seeger, Dolly Parton, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, and Joan Baez, yet the question posed in Guthrie&#x2019;s lyrics, &#x201c;Who are these friends all scattered like dry leaves?&#x201d; would remain unanswered&#x2014;until now.</p><p>Combining years of painstaking investigative research and masterful storytelling, award-winning author Tim Z. Hernandez weaves a captivating narrative from testimony, historical records, and eyewitness accounts, reconstructing the incident and the lives behind the legendary song. This singularly original account pushes narrative boundaries, while challenging perceptions of what it means to be an immigrant in America, but more importantly, it renders intimate portraits of the individual souls who, despite social status, race, or nationality, shared a common fate one frigid morning in January 1948.</p></p><p><em>All They Will Call You</em> is the harrowing account of &#x201c;the worst airplane disaster in California&#x2019;s history,&#x201d; the 28 unnamed Mexican lives it claimed, and the Woody Guthrie anthem it inspired.<p>Tim Z.

Soon after my birth I lived in Williamston, Michigan and then moved onto my grandparents farm in Union City, Michigan.<p>"I lived on the farm with my mom and Grandparents until 1949. That is when my Babushka (my grandmother) died and we prepared to move away from Michigan. I must say that living on that little farm with them was the most magical time of my life...and that my Babushka and other grandparents were some of the most inspirational people in my life.</p><p>"My parents were divorced when I was 3, and both my father and mother moved back into the homes of their parents. I spent the school year with my mother, and the summers with my dad. In both households I was the apple of my grandparents' eyes! I would say that these relationships with my grandparents have most definitely influenced my life and my work. You probably have noticed that in almost every book that I write there is a very young person who is interacting with an elderly person. Personally, I feel that this is the most valuable experience of my life....having the wonder of knowing both children and elderly people.</p><p>"The respect that I learned as a very young person certainly carried over into my life in later years. I have always like hearing stories from these folks. My genuine curiosity for the wonder of living a very long life prepared me to accept the declining years of my own parents.</p><p>"To get back to the farm in Union City...this place was so magical to me that I have never forgotten it! This was the place where I heard such wonderful stories told...this was the place that a real meteor fell into our font yard...that very meteorite is now our family headstone in the graveyard here in Union City.</p><p>"Did I tell you that I now live in Union City? This is after living in Oakland, California for almost 37 years. But, you see, every year I'd come back to Michigan to see my Dad and family.</p><p>"Anyway...</p><p>"In 1949 we left the farm to move, first to Coral Gables, Florida. I lived there with my Mom and my brother, Richard, for almost 3 years. Then we moved to Oakland, California. I remained there for most of my young life on into my adulthood. We lived on Ocean View Drive in the Rockridge District. What I loved the most about this neighborhood is that all of my neighbors came in as many colors, ideas and religions as there are people on the planet. How lucky I was to know so many people that were so different and yet so much alike.</p><p>"It is on Ocean View that I met my best friend, Stewart Grinnell Washington. We are best friends to this day! He has a younger brother, Winston and three sisters; Jackie, Terry and Robin. When I was a student in elementary school I wasn't a very good student. I had a terrible time with reading and math. As a matter of fact, I did not learn how to read until I was almost 14 years old. Can you imagine what it was like to see all my friends do so well in school and I wasn't! I thought I was dumb. I didn't like school because there was this boy that always teased me and made me feel even dumber. When I was fourteen, it was learned that I have a learning disability. It is called dyslexia. I felt trapped in a body that wouldn't do what everybody else could do. That was when one of my hero's, my teacher, found what was wrong with me and got me the help I needed to succeed in school. Of course, now that I am an adult, I realize that being learning disabled does not mean DUMB AT ALL! As a matter of fact, I have learned that being learning disabled only means that I cannot learn the way most of you do. As a matter of fact, most learning disabled children are actually GENIUSES! Once I learned how to read and caught up with the rest of my fellow students, I did very well.</p><p>"I went on to University, majored in Fine Art, then went on to do a graduate degree and even ended up with a Ph.D. in Art History. For a time I restored ancient pieces of art for museums. I eventually became the mother of two children, Steven and Traci, and devoted much of my days to their education and upbringing.</p><p>"I did not start writing children's books until I was 41 years old. Mind you the "art" has always been there for me most of my life. Apparently one of the symptoms of my disability in academics is the ability of draw very, very well. So drawing, painting and sculpture has always been a part of my life even before I started illustrating my books. The books were quite a surprise, really. Mind you, I came from a family of incredible storytellers. My mother's people were from the Ukraine and Russia...my father's people were from Ireland. My extended family,(Stewart's family) were from the bayous of Louisiana...also great story tellers. When you are raised on HEARING stories.....NOT SEEING THEM, you become very good at telling stories yourself. So at the age of 41 I started putting stories that I told down on paper and did drawings to help illustrate them...I guess the rest is history.</p><p>"I have enjoyed a wonderful career of writing books for children . Who could have guessed that little girl that was having such a tough time in school would end up an illustrator and author. Children and adults alike ask me where I get my ideas...I get them from the same place that you do....MY IMAGINATION... I would guess the reason my imagination is so fertile is because I came from storytelling and, WE DID NOT OWN A T.V.!!!!!!!!! You see, when one is a writer, actor, dancer, musician; a creator of any kind, he or she does these things because they listen to that "voice" inside of them. All of us have that "voice". It is where all inspired thoughts come from....but when you have electronic screens in front, of you, speaking that voice for you... it DROWNS OUT THE VOICE! When I talk to children and aspiring writers, I always ask them to listen to the voice, turn off the T.V. and</p><p>"LISTEN...LISTEN...LISTEN.</p><p>"Now that I have moved back to Union City I am intending to open my house and community and invite people to come there to take part in writing seminars, story telling festivals, literature conferences and various events that celebrate children's literature."</p><p>Born Patricia Ann Barber in Lansing, Michigan, to parents of Russian and Ukrainian descent on one side and Irish on the other, Patricia Polacco grew up in both California and Michigan. Her school year was spent in Oakland, California, and summers in her beloved Michigan. She describes her family members as marvelous storytellers. "My fondest memories are of sitting around a stove or open fire, eating apples and popping corn while listening to the old ones tell glorious stories about their homeland and the past. We are tenacious traditionalists and sentimentalists.... With each retelling our stories gain a little more Umph!"</p><p>Studying in the United States and Australia, Patricia Polacco has earned an M.F.A. and a Ph. D. in art history, specializing in Russian and Greek painting, and iconographic history. She is a museum consultant on the restoration of icons. As a participant in many citizen exchange programs for writers and illustrators, Patricia Polacco has traveled extensively in Russia as well as other former Soviet republics. She continues to support programs that encourage Russo-American friendships and understanding. She is also deeply involved in inner-city projects here in the U.S. that promote the peaceful resolution of conflict and encourage art and literacy programs.</p><p>The mother of a grown son and a daughter, Patricia Polacco currently resides in Michigan, where she has a glorious old farm that was built during the time of Lincoln.</p><p>copyright � 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

On Sundays, she often attends Baptist services with her friends, and Miss Eula fixes a sumptuous fried chicken dinner with all the trimmings, after stopping to admire the hats in Mr. Kodinski's shop. The youngsters hope to buy her one, but when they approach the merchant looking for work, he mistakenly accuses them of pelting his shop with eggs. To prove their innocence, the children hand-dye eggs in the folk-art style that Patricia's grandmother had taught her and present them to the milliner. Moved by the rememberance of his homeland, the Russian Jewish emigre encourages the children to sell the ``Pysanky'' eggs in his shop and rewards their industry with a gift of the hat, which Miss Eula proudly wears on Easter Sunday. Polacco's tale resonates with the veracity of a personal recollection and is replete with vivid visual and visceral images. Her unique illustrative style smoothly blends detailed line drawing, impressionistic painting, primitive felt-marker coloring, and collage work with actual photographs, resulting in a feast for the eyes as filling as Miss Eula's Chicken Sunday spreads. The palette is equally varied, while the application of color is judiciously relieved by sporadic pencil sketches. An authentic tale of childhood friendship. --Dorothy Houlihan, formerly at White Plains Pub .

In the title, the author, a chief of the Lenap'e Nation, refers to the fact that the Lenap'e are viewed as the grandfathers of the Algonquins. The legends show how Nanapush, the grandfather of all beings, created the earth upon the back of a turtle; how the Lenap'e people settled along the Eastern coast of the United States; and the value of tobacco and the crow, which brought fire to earth. H'itakonanu'laxk reveals how the Lenap'e storytellers were revered as bringers of good luck as they traveled from one settlement to the next to tell their tales.

Due to a tragedy at birth, Oliver de Vinck was born severely handicapped&#x2014;blind, mute, crippled, helpless. Despite the doctors' bleak prognosis, his loving parents took him home, where they and their children cared for him.

I could almost hear her voice, with its strong Irish brogue, as I sat on the sofa and sipped a glass of lemonade on a hot July day.<br>Frankly, I rather wished that Satan would find me something to do with my idle hands because I was dying of boredom. All my life I&#x2019;d been used to hard work, forced to care for my father and three young brothers after my mother went to her heavenly rest. (At least I presume that&#x2019;s where she went. She certainly thought she deserved it.) And now, for the first time in my life, I was a lady of leisure. Ever since I found out I was in the family way, back in February, Daniel had treated me as if I was made of fine porcelain. For the first few months I was glad of his solicitous behavior toward me as I was horribly sick. In fact I began to feel more sympathy for my mother, who had gone through this at least four times. But then, at the start of the fourth month, a miraculous change occurred. I awoke one morning to find that I felt well and hungry and full of energy. Daniel, however, still insisted that I did as little as possible, did not exert myself, took no risks, and generally behave like one of those helpless females I so despised.<br>He wanted me to lie on the couch with my feet up and spend my days making little garments. I had tried to do this and the quality of my sewing and knitting had improved, but still left a lot to be desired. Besides, I knew that my mother-in-law was sewing away diligently and that my neighbors Sid and Gus would shower the child with expensive presents.<br>So this left long hours to be filled every day. Our little house on Patchin Place could be cleaned in a couple of hours. I did a little shopping, but Daniel&#x2019;s job as a police captain meant that he was seldom home for lunch and sometimes not even for dinner, so little cooking was required. I was glad of this when the weather turned hot at the end of June as my growing bulk meant that I felt the heat badly. Daniel suggested that he could fend for himself just fine and I should go up to his mother in Westchester County, where I&#x2019;d be cooler and well looked after. I didn&#x2019;t say it out loud but I&#x2019;d rather have endured a fiery furnace than a prolonged stay with Daniel&#x2019;s mother. Not that she was an ogre or anything, but her standards of perfection and her social interactions with members of high society left me feeling hopelessly inadequate. I knew that she was disappointed that Daniel had not made a better match than an Irish girl with no money and no family connections.<br>She never actually came out and said this, but she made it plain enough. &#x201c;I took tea with the Harpers yesterday,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say. &#x201c;I remember that one of the Harper girls was rather sweet on you at one time, Daniel. She&#x2019;s gone on to make an excellent marriage with one of the Van Baarens. Her parents couldn&#x2019;t be happier.&#x201d; And then she&#x2019;d look at me.<br>So I was prepared to endure any amount of heat rather than Daniel&#x2019;s mother. I just wished these last months would hurry up and be over. I put down my lemonade glass and picked up the undershirt I had been attempting to sew. I could see sweaty fingerprints on the fine white cotton and several places where the stitches had been unpicked. I sighed. I just wasn&#x2019;t cut out to be a seamstress. As a detective I hadn&#x2019;t done at all badly, but that profession was now closed to me. Daniel had made me promise that I&#x2019;d give up my agency when we married. I had hoped that Daniel would share his cases with me, that we&#x2019;d sit at the kitchen table and he&#x2019;d ask for my opinion. But he had claimed that his recent cases had been too commonplace to be worth discussing or else so confidential that he had to remain tight-lipped about them.<br>I looked up as the sun suddenly streamed in through the back parlor windows. A sunbeam lit the dust motes in the air and painted a stripe of brightness on the wallpaper. Now this room would soon be too hot for comfort and I&#x2019;d be banished to the front parlor, dark and gloomy, until the sun set. I got up to draw the heavy velvet drapes across the window and noticed that the lace curtains looked rather dingy. That would never do. Having achieved lace curtains for the first time in my life, I should make sure that they remained a pristine white. I went into the kitchen and brought back a high-backed wooden chair. I proceeded to climb on this with some difficulty, then I reached up to unhook the first of the lace curtains.<br>I was at full stretch, standing on tiptoe, when a voice behind me boomed, &#x201c;Molly! What in God&#x2019;s name do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,&#x201d; I exclaimed. I teetered, and would have fallen if I hadn&#x2019;t grabbed at the velvet drape, which held fast. I looked around to see Daniel standing there with a face like thunder.<br>&#x201c;The curtains needed washing.&#x201d; I glared at him defiantly.<br>&#x201c;You were risking the safety of our baby for the sake of clean curtains?&#x201d; he demanded. He came over and helped me down from the chair. &#x201c;You nearly fell, and what might have happened then?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It was only a voice suddenly shouting right behind me that made me lose my balance,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Until you showed up I was doing just fine.&#x201d;<br>He looked at me more tenderly now. &#x201c;Molly, how many times have I told you to take it easy. You&#x2019;re in a delicate condition, my dear.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nonsense. Women in Ireland have their babies one day and by the end of the week they&#x2019;re out helping their man in the fields again.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And how many of those babies die? Your mother didn&#x2019;t live long herself, did she?&#x201d;<br>I chose not to acknowledge the truth in this. Instead I said breezily, &#x201c;Daniel, I feel fine and I&#x2019;m bored to tears doing nothing.&#x201d;<br>He took my arm and led me back to the sofa. &#x201c;Then invite some friends over to tea. I&#x2019;ve introduced you to the wives of some of my colleagues, haven&#x2019;t I? It&#x2019;s about time you built up a circle of social acquaintances. And there are always your friends across the street,&#x201d; he added grudgingly, not being as keen as I on my bohemian neighbors.<br>I sighed. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve gone to stay with Gus&#x2019;s relatives in Newport, Rhode Island, to escape the heat,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You remember the mansion with the Roman pillars.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Very well.&#x201d; We&#x2019;d spent our honeymoon in Newport and it had hardly gone as planned. Daniel pulled up the kitchen chair and sat beside me. &#x201c;So why don&#x2019;t you go to my mother as I suggested? You know she&#x2019;d love to make a fuss of you, and feed you well, and it&#x2019;s so much cooler out there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Daniel, I&#x2019;m your wife. My place is taking care of you,&#x201d; I replied, not wanting to tell him the real reason. Isn&#x2019;t it amazing what marriage does to a woman? I was finally learning to be diplomatic. I was one step away from being simpering.<br>&#x201c;I can fend for myself quite well. I&#x2019;ve been doing it for years.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But you work long hours, Daniel. It&#x2019;s not right that you should come home to no supper and no clean clothes.&#x201d;<br>He wagged a finger at me. &#x201c;What have I been telling you for months? Then this is the perfect time to get a servant.&#x201d;<br>I sighed. &#x201c;Daniel, let&#x2019;s not go through that again. We really don&#x2019;t need a servant. This is a small house. I&#x2019;m used to hard work. I&#x2019;m happy to cook and clean for you, and for our baby too. If a few more children start to come along, then I may need some help, but for the present....&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just the amount of work, Molly. It&#x2019;s the principle of the thing. A man in my position should have a servant. When we start entertaining more, it wouldn&#x2019;t be right that you&#x2019;d have to keep disappearing into the kitchen to see to the dinner. I want you to be the gracious hostess.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I see,&#x201d; I said, my rising temper now winning out over my newfound meekness. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not concern about me at all, is it? You&#x2019;re worried about how you appear in the eyes of society.&#x201d;<br>He looked at my expression and took my hand. &#x201c;Molly, this is not for myself, it&#x2019;s for us. Everything I do from now on is for my family. I want the best for us and for our children. I want to rise in the world, it&#x2019;s true, and I&#x2019;ll be judged on the kind of home I keep and the people I associate with.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;And I want the world to see that I married a beautiful woman.&#x201d;<br>I had to smile at this. &#x201c;You may have been born in America, Daniel Sullivan,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but you&#x2019;ve certainly inherited your share of Irish blarney!&#x201d;<br>He smiled too. &#x201c;I am thinking of you, Molly. If you&#x2019;re up all night with a crying baby, you&#x2019;ll appreciate a girl taking over from you so you can get your rest. You say you&#x2019;re bored and have nothing to do&#x2014;well, what better time to train a servant so that she knows your wishes and how this household works by the time the baby arrives?&#x201d;<br>I hesitated, then said, &#x201c;Well, I suppose I could start making inquiries.&#x201d;<br>He jumped to his feet. &#x201c;I know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t I write to my mother and ask for her help in this?&#x201d;<br>Now my hackles truly were rising. &#x201c;Why does your mother have to come into every aspect of our lives?&#x201d; I demanded. &#x201c;Do you not believe I&#x2019;m capable of finding a servant for myself?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course you are. I&#x2019;m simply trying to spare you extra toil and bother. I don&#x2019;t want you traipsing around the city at this time of year. They say there...</p><h2>The Complete Stories of J. G. Ballard</h2><p><p><strong>A collection of 98 enthralling and pulse-quickening stories, spanning five decades, venerates the remarkable imagination of J. G. Ballard.</strong></p> With a body of work unparalleled in twentieth-century literature, J. G. Ballard is recognized as one of the greatest and most prophetic writers in the world. With the much-hailed release of <em>The Complete Stories of J. G. Ballard</em>, readers now have a means to celebrate the unmatched range and mesmerizing cadences of a literary genius. Whether writing about musical orchids, human cannibalism, or the secret history of World War III, Ballard's <em>Complete Stories</em> evokes the hallucinations of Kafka and Borges in its ability to render modern paranoia and fantastical creations on the page. A <em>Washington Post</em> Best Book of 2009, <em>Boston Globe</em> Best Book, <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Favorite Book, and <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> Best Book.</p><p>&#34;More than one thousand compelling pages from one of the most haunting, cogent, and individual imaginations in contemporary literature.&#34;-William BoydNever before published in its entirety in America, with many stories new to American readers, The Complete Stories of J. G. Ballard is a monumental achievement by one of our greatest literary geniuses. Featuring such classics as &#34;Prima Belladonna,&#34; &#34;The Drowned Giant,&#34; and &#34;The Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race,&#34; the book evokes Poe and Kafka, Borges and Bradbury in its astonishing ability to render psychosis and modern paranoia in phantasmagorical detail on the printed page.Praise for J.G. Ballard: &#34;Ballard will be remembered as the most original English writer of the last century . . . [and] as a one-man genre; no one else is remotely like him. . . . He was sui generis. What was influential, though, was the marvelous creaminess of his prose, and the weird and sudden expansions of his imagery.&#34;-Martin Amis, The Guardian&#34;When I was a boy, I loved J. G. Ballard. And when I was a teenager, I loved J. G. Ballard. And as an adult, I loved J. G. Ballard.&#34;-Neil Gaiman&#34;For anyone bored with the stale conventions of mainstream fiction, his 90-odd short stories of stilled time, desolate beauty and personal fulfillment in extreme situations will be sheer delight.&#34;-John Gray, The New Statesman&#34;[W]ho would argue that ours is not a time of nihilism and that Ballard is not the ideal chronicler of our disturbed modernity?&#34;-Jason Cowley, The Observer<p><strong>J.G. Ballard</strong> was born in Shanghai in 1930 and lived in England from 1946 until his death in London in 2009. He is the author of nineteen novels, including <em>Empire of the Sun</em>, <em>The Drought</em>, and <em>Crash</em>, with many of them made into major films.</p><p><b>Martin Amis</b> is one of Britain's most prolific post-war writers and a professor of creative writing at the University of Manchester.

A new serial number list is included with serial number ranges listed by production years. This new list includes serial numbers not previously included by other authors. </p><p>This book makes it possible for the collector to determine whether or not a particular rifle, carbine or cadet rifle is original as manufactured. The collector must keep in mind that not only was the .45-70 Springfield Trapdoor used by the Army, but also by the Navy, Marines, National Guard and various state militias from 1873 to well into the 20th Century. The trapdoor was still being issued as late as World War I to militia units for guard duty. </p><p>During this more than forty-year period of service, the trapdoor went through several model changes and even more frequent parts upgrades. So a rifle manufactured in 1879 may have undergone as many as twenty parts changes by 1889, all of which are considered valid, original manufacturing changes. The problem the collector, museum director, gunsmith, author and shooter faces is determining which changes were made officially by the Ordnance Department while in service and which were made by surplus dealers, resellers and previous non-military owners. </p><p>"The .45-70 Springfield" provides answers to all these questions and more. With this book in hand, it is possible to assess every part and using the serial number stamped on the receiver, determine first in what year the arm was manufactured, then on a part-by-part basis, decide whether or not each part is the correct and original part for that arm. If some parts are found to have been manufactured later, then the book will tell you whether or not those parts were installed by military armorers according to regulation. </p><p>Why is this important? First, the .45-70 Springfield is a tangible piece of the history of our nation. And as such, it deserves to be correct. Secondly, the .45-70 Springfield's value depends in large part on how original it is. Parts that are incorrect can be replaced, returning the arm to both its historical and economic value. The book also provides a historical overview of the .45-70's development and use during the latter part of the 19th Century and into the 20th. Also included are assembly/disassembly instructions, cleaning and maintenance, glossary and bibliography.</p></p><p>The .45-70 Springfield is a thoroughly researched text incorporating the latest information available that will help the collector and shooter of this fine antique firearm to evaluate, maintain and appreciate the &#34;gun that [truly] win the west.&#34;Joe Poyer is the author of more than 400 magazine articles on firearms, the modern military, military history and personal security.

She is the mother of two and, in a particularly delicious irony for a romance writer, is married to a genuine Italian knight. Visit her at www.eloisajames.com.</p>Fresh and witty, this high-spirited Regency-era romance gives a tried-and-true formula a merry spin. Cam Serrard, the duke of Girton, leapt out of a window and ran off to Greece immediately after being forced into wedding 11-year-old Gina. Instead of resenting him, however, Gina spends the next 12 years sending him friendly letters. When Cam finally returns to England to grant Gina an annulment so she can marry a marquess who loves her, the warm easiness between the childhood friends doesn't surprise them, but the flare of desire does. Before long, Gina starts to wonder if being the wife of a nude-sculpting, frequently absent and socially careless duke might not be such a bad future. Chatter among Gina and her friends has the modern ring of a Sex and the City episode, and James's cheeky, sometimes sly humor makes for frequent laugh-out-loud moments. Avoiding easy stereotypes, James fleshes out all of her characters and gives them depths of emotion that romances seldom allocate to supporting characters. Though each chapter is headed by a droll description of the events to come, readers may find themselves too caught up in the snowballing action to take much notice.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Black Sands (Aloha Reef Series)</h2><p><p><strong>Page-turning romantic suspense set amid the gorgeous beauty of Hawaii and the impending danger of a volcano.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>A brainy&#x2014;and perpetually single&#x2014;volcanologist, Annie Tagama works alongside her father at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.

Vog burned her nose and eyes. She barely noticed the stink of sulfuric gases that hung in a miasma around her. The thick air was as much a part of her world as the rough lava under her feet and the blue Hawaiian sky over her head. Even though she knew she was safe here in this stable part of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, caution dictated her choices on this work day--her first since the accident. </p> <p> "Can you bring me a new GPS receiver?" Monica Rogers called from the edge of the lava shelf. "This one is shot." The older woman's voice reminded Annie of Minnie Mouse, and it didn't match Monica's stocky frame. </p> <p> Annie stood and took two steps toward Monica. She peered toward the drop-off, where heavy clouds of sulfuric mist billowed. Sweat broke out on her forehead. Her lungs constricted. You can do it. It's safe. She swallowed the sour taste in her mouth. Carrying the new receiver, she took a few more steps. </p> <p> "Hurry up!" Monica squeaked. </p> <p> "I'll do it." Annie's best friend, Fawn Trenton, took the receiver from her hand, her expression warning Annie not to cross Monica. </p> <p> Annie froze, and Fawn hurried toward Monica. Thirtysomething Fawn turned heads wherever she went. Her tawny hair gleamed in the filtered wash of sunshine. Bright blue beads decorated the long braid that hung over one shoulder. Her T-shirt read SAVE THE RAIN FOREST. </p> <p> Annie stepped away from the edge and sighed with relief. She had to get over this fear that turned her knees to jelly, but she wasn't sure how to go about it. The shelf out there was perfectly safe. It hadn't had a collapse in years. But her face was still damp, and her pulse still galloped. She was such a failure. </p> <p> Turning her back on the other women, she returned to her task. Her pack held cans of yellow spray paint. She grabbed one and began to spray the cracks in the ground. Watching the paint over the coming weeks would tell the scientists about the earth's movement. She forced herself to focus, though it was hard not to let her gaze stray to the vog drifting up from the drop-off. </p> <p> Half an hour later, Monica and Fawn joined Annie near the two all-terrain vehicles. Monica's lips were tight, and she kept shooting angry glares toward Annie. "I'm going to headquarters," she said. Her movements stiff, she stalked to her ATV and drove off. </p> <p> "I hope she doesn't rat on you," Fawn said. </p> <p> Annie bit her lip. "I don't think Gina will listen if she does." Limping toward her ATV, she saw a glint of metal in the sun. She stooped and picked up a delicate necklace. What was this doing here? The familiarity made her catch her breath. It couldn't be her sister's, could it? Surely there were many necklaces like this on the island. </p> <p> Fawn peered over her shoulder. "What's wrong?" </p> <p> Annie turned over the heart-shaped pendant and saw the initials A. T. on the back. "It's Leilani's," she muttered. She rubbed her forehead. </p> <p> "How did it get here? Your sister wouldn't set foot on the volcano if you paid her." </p> <p> Unease began to coil in Annie's chest. "She didn't come home last night. I figured she was out with her friends and didn't think much about it. You know how she is. I'm sure she called Father after I left the house this morning." But that didn't explain the necklace's appearance out here. </p> <p> Fawn's gaze followed hers. "Maybe she loaned it to someone? Did you borrow it a few days ago and forget about it?" </p> <p> Annie shook her head. "She never takes off this necklace. Mother gave it to her the week before she died. Leilani even showers in it. These are Mother's initials. A. T. Adele Tagama." When their mother committed suicide a year ago, she and Leilani both had clung to anything of their mother's. Her thoughts boiled with possibilities--all of them dire. </p> <p> Fawn squeezed Annie's arm. "Don't go jumping to conclusions. Maybe it broke and someone found it." </p> <p> It was hard not to jump to conclusions, not after her mother had died out here. She'd thrown herself into the lava, leaving only her Surfah flip-flops behind. Blue ones that Annie kept on her dresser. She shuddered. Trouble had been Leilani's middle name since then. Annie was ill equipped to deal with Leilani's rebellious ways. Though her sister was only five years younger than Annie's thirty years, sometimes Annie felt generations older. </p> <p> Annie told herself not to worry. There was likely a perfectly reasonable explanation. "You're probably right. It's not unlike her to be gone overnight. It's just this necklace." She went toward their vehicle. "I'd better check and see if my dad has heard from her. I'll call some of her friends. I'm sure there's some explanation." </p> <p> Fawn followed her. "Annie to the rescue. Don't you ever get tired of being the one that everyone leans on? You'll never get to live your own life." </p> <p> "I love my family," Annie said. They reached the Kawasaki ATV. "Hop on, let's go." </p> <p> Fawn shrugged and got behind her. "Your family's expectations are going to kill you. I hate to see the way you beat yourself up when you can't do everything. Have you been drinking the chamomile tea I gave you? It should help with the stress." </p> <p> Annie grinned. "Yes, doctor." </p> <p> "I know you think I harp on this too much, but you've taken over everything for them since your mom died. They're never going to let you have a life if you make it too easy for them. They've all turned into babies. They're adults. Make them act like it." </p> <p> "I know, I know. I will." Annie negotiated the a'a trail carefully. She didn't dare drive too fast, or the sharp bits of lava would shred the ATV's tires. The a'a finally gave way to black gravel, and she picked up her speed. "Harp is a good word. On a double-word square it would be worth eighteen points." Talking about Scrabble was better than thinking about the necklace in her pocket. Or about how accurate Fawn's observations were. Things had changed for the Tagama family, but there was no going back. Annie couldn't bear to see her family suffer anymore, not if she could shoulder the burdens for them and ease their lives. </p> <p> "I should save my breath," Fawn said. "I was going to offer to get you an appointment at the Fairmont for a Lomilomi massage, but you don't deserve it." </p> <p> Fawn knew how to stab her where it hurt. "Meanie." Annie turned the corner onto concrete. The long, squat building that housed the offices sat at the top of a small rise and was surrounded by lava fields. To the right of the Hawai'i Volcanoes Observatory was the Jagger Museum, containing a history of the Hawai'i volcanoes. Scientists from all over the world came here to study the geological processes that triggered volcanic activity. She parked the ATV and waited for Fawn to hop off, then dismounted. </p> <p> Fawn smoothed the locks of hair the wind had teased from her braid. "You're too young to spend your life in front of a board game. When was the last time you went to the movies or even out to eat?" </p> <p> Annie scrunched her forehead as she thought. "Um, the last time you and I went. I guess it was last month," she said. </p> <p> "My point exactly. Five weeks ago, to be exact. I've invited you to do something every Friday since then too, and you always say you have to fix dinner for your dad. That's not normal, Annie. You're only thirty, not eighty. And you're letting him become a tyrant. I think he thinks he's a Japanese emperor from the 1800s now that your mom isn't around to keep him in line." </p> <p> "I know, I know." The parking lot beside the squat brick building was nearly empty, and Annie realized it was after five o'clock. Gina's car was still in the lot though. Annie started toward her Nissan Pathfinder. A movement at the office door caught her eye, and she glanced up to see her boss waving at her imperiously. </p> <p> "Annie, I need to see you," Gina called. </p> <p> Annie sighed. Fawn raised her eyebrows. Their boss, Gina Sarris, turned and walked back inside. Judging from Gina's stiff back, Annie was headed for trouble. Annie limped toward the building. She didn't have time for this. </p> <p> The hum of the banks of computers greeted her as she opened the door. The familiar squawk of the scanner and the click of the seismometer eased her tension a little. She went down the hall, which was lined with pictures of volcanoes in various stages of eruption. Other walls held photo essays of the various studies going on--projects like gravitational studies, electrical processes, gas geochemistry, and ground deformation. She stepped into her boss's office. It was empty. She went to the office chair by the window. </p> <p> "Sorry to keep you." Gina came into the room and moved to her desk. Barely five feet tall, she still wore the heavy work pants she donned when out in the field. A stench of sulfur followed her. The cracked leather chair practically swallowed her. She pulled her glasses to her nose, then flipped open a folder. </p> <p> "I need to get home right away." Annie slipped her hand into her pocket and fingered her sister's necklace. </p> <p> Gina gave her a kind smile. "Don't look so scared, Annie. We're just going to talk." </p> <p> Gina had taken over as Scientist-in-charge a little over a year ago. Things had run smoothly under Gina's supreme organizational skills. Her dark hair never dared to be out of place, and every paper clip on her desk was perfectly aligned. Though in her fifties, she was still beautiful with perfect, unlined skin. She had a faint accent no one had been able to figure out. With her dark coloring, she could be French, Greek, part Hawaiian, or any of the other nationalities in this melting pot. </p> <p> Annie knew Gina liked her. That was the only thing that might save this interview from going south. "Okay." She moved toward Gina's desk. </p> <p> "It's good to have you back. How have you been feeling? I noticed you're only limping a little now." </p> <p> "Pretty good.

Sensitive skin prevalence has skyrocketed, and the number of people reacting to cosmetics is climbing. Why? Dermatologist Sandy Skotnicki argues that the cause is a key element of our contemporary lifestyle: the grooming and beauty habits that the advertising and personal-care product industries have encouraged us to pursue. Those miraculous cleansers, creams and balms we're buying to protect our outer layer may actually end up harming the body's largest organ.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Beyond Soap</i>, Dr. Skotnicki argues that the best state for normal skin is the natural state&#x2014;the one that avoids disturbing the skin's protective barrier and the bacteria that accompanied the body throughout its evolution. A combination of diagnosis and prescription, Dr. Skotnicki explains the problem with society's current cleansing and beauty habits, then provides a practical guide on how to fix things with a 3-step product-elimination diet that will help you remove unnecessary and potentially harmful ingredients from your beauty and skincare regime, returning the skin to the condition nature intended. <i>Beyond Soap</i> also includes indispensable advice on how to wash and care for the skin of adults, babies and children, followed by a common-sense beauty regimen intended to stave off aging, reduce skin problems and return the face and body to its natural glow.</p><p>DR.

He lives in Toronto.&nbsp;<br> INTRODUCTION: AN EPIDEMIC<br><br> I&#x2019;ve been practising as a dermatologist for 20 years. I&#x2019;m also on the faculty of the University of Toronto&#x2019;s Department of Medicine. My academic interest is contact dermatitis, or reactions to the things that come into <i>contact </i>with the skin. And during my decades in practice I&#x2019;ve seen an alarming increase in the number of patients walking into my examining room with a certain kind of skin problem. <br> &nbsp;<br> The least serious cases complain about sensitive skin. These patients are hyper-aware of whatever&#x2019;s touching them; in fact, they&#x2019;re hyper-aware of their skin. Moving up the scale of severity, there are patients who complain of burning and stinging anytime they put skin products onto themselves, whether the product is moisturizer, soap, sunscreen or something else. Others experience flare-ups due to the friction from their clothing, the wind or sun exposure. We&#x2019;re talking eruptions that range from mild redness to burning or stinging of the face. It might be persistently dry and cracked hands. Or the sensation that the skin or scalp is covered with insects. <br> &nbsp;<br> Some cases are so severe that patients can&#x2019;t work or sleep because of the constant itch. The reactions affect people&#x2019;s self-esteem and hamper their ability to function. Some feel so ashamed of their rashes that they don&#x2019;t want to go outside. The problems can make many people&#x2019;s lives a living hell.<br> &nbsp;<br> The type of skin problem I&#x2019;m talking about, in all its forms, is caused by beauty products. And it&#x2019;s becoming an epidemic. The number of patients I see to treat these reactions has spiked in recent years. I believe my practice is representative of those in developed countries; dermatologists all over the world are noticing increasing numbers. <br> &nbsp;<br> In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration made public, for the first time, comprehensive statistics on adverse events related to cosmetic and beauty products. The data trend was alarming in the extreme. For such products as moisturizers, shampoos and conditioners, shaving creams, cleansers, baby products and makeup&#x2014;the whole of the skincare and beauty product universe, in other words&#x2014;the FDA registered 291 adverse events in 2013, 436 in 2014, 706 in 2015 and a remarkable 1591 in 2016. Those represent percentage increases of 50 percent, 62 percent and 125 percent in the last three years. You might think these numbers are small relative to population size, but bear in mind, these are events that are <i>reported </i>to the FDA. A team from Northwestern University medical school analyzed the data for a study in a major medical journal (<i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>). The study authors noted that the FDA&#x2019;s database &#x201c;reflects only a small proportion of all events.&#x201d; That is, the actual number of reactions to cosmetic and beauty products is certain to be far higher. Health Canada tracks its own reports on human health and safety concerns related to various types of consumer products&#x2014;and cosmetics consistently places among the top five reported sectors. <br> &nbsp;<br> Or consider what&#x2019;s been happening in the last half-century or so with a condition known as eczema&#x2014;inflamed, scaly, itchy skin. It affects more young people than old. In the 1940s, eczema was relatively rare, affecting just 5 percent of children and comparatively unknown in adults. Today, localities exist where 25 percent of young people suffer from the condition. Adult eczema now affects about 10 percent of adults in the U.S. One interesting thing about eczema is that people with it become more likely to experience other problems, such as asthma and hay fever. A survey that focused on an individual city&#x2014;Aberdeen, Scotland&#x2014;found that rates of eczema had increased by three times between 1964 and 1999, while rates of hay fever and asthma had increased by four and five times, respectively. As John McFadden, a dermatologist at London&#x2019;s St. Thomas&#x2019; Hospital, wrote in the <i>British Journal of Dermatology</i>, the skyrocketing eczema rates reflect &#x201c;a general trend in industrialized countries,&#x201d; and that &#x201c;during the last decade this increased prevalence has persisted.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The <i>really </i>dramatic increase over time has happened with another condition, known as sensitive skin, which is pretty much what it sounds like&#x2014;skin that is ultra-reactive, intolerant, possibly itchy or otherwise painful, and sometimes, but not always, accompanied by some kind of a rash. The condition is the biggest trend in my practice as well as many others throughout the developed world. <br> &nbsp;<br> This epidemic troubles some of the world&#x2019;s most respected dermatologists. &#x201c;The reported prevalence of self-perceived skin sensitivity has increased steadily over time,&#x201d; notes a 2013 article co-authored by the American dermatological legend Howard Maibach. &#x201c;Knowledgeable, experienced observers agree that the subject is not trivial, causes a great deal of distress, and is more than a cosmetic nuisance or a mere matter of vanity,&#x201d; comments a 2006 article lead-authored by Albert Kligman, the co-inventor of Retin-A. <br> &nbsp;<br> Reports suggest that 40 percent of people worldwide consider themselves to have sensitive skin. That&#x2019;s a <i>remarkable </i>amount. And the research shows that the prevalence can be even higher in individual countries. One survey revealed that approximately 69 percent of American women self-identified as having sensitive skin. Nearly 85 percent of women in France claimed to be plagued by it. And a whopping 91 percent of Italians told researchers that they suffered from the condition. <br> &nbsp;<br> Adverse events from beauty products. Skyrocketing rates of eczema. Huge numbers of people reporting that they have sensitive skin. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>What on earth is going on? </i><br> &nbsp;<br> This is the 21st century! We have instantaneous access to nearly any TV show or movie ever filmed. Driverless taxis are an actual thing! In so many ways, it seems, we&#x2019;re living in the future&#x2014;so why does it seem as if we&#x2019;re having more skin problems than ever? Shouldn&#x2019;t the modern lifestyle have solved this problem by now? <br> &nbsp;<br> But here&#x2019;s the thing: <i>What if that modern lifestyle is part of the problem?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;&#x2014;<br><br>Evolution invented skin millions of years ago&#x2014;and until relatively recently, we&#x2019;ve left it to its own devices. Even our great-grandparents started their lives at a time when most people considered a weekly bath to be the height of cleanliness.<br> &nbsp;<br> But then, in the last 70 or so years, we decided that this wonderful invention <i>wasn&#x2019;t good enough</i>. We decided it needed help. So began the practice of daily showering. The use of soap several times a day to cleanse the skin. The more-than-daily application of moisturizers and makeup. <br> &nbsp;<br> These customs are <i>incredibly </i>recent in historical terms. <br><br>The bathing and grooming customs of developed societies are a major contributor to the recent epidemic of skin problems. We think we&#x2019;re taking care of ourselves by bathing at least every day, cleansing our faces and bodies multiple times a day, shampooing several times a week. Not to mention all the other things we do to our skin. But the irony is, many of the things we&#x2019;re doing to <i>take care </i>of our skin actually end up <i>harming </i>it. <br> &nbsp;<br> You read that right: The way we&#x2019;re taking care of our skin today is <i>the wrong approach</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> Whether it&#x2019;s the women in lab coats at the cosmetics counter or the glammed-up influencers on YouTube and Instagram, the conventional wisdom is cleanse, cleanse again, exfoliate, moisturize, protect. <i>Spend </i>more money, <i>buy </i>more products, <i>take </i>more time. No, these things aren&#x2019;t necessary! In fact, most of that advice actually contradicts the academic literature!<br> &nbsp;<br> What&#x2019;s responsible for the increase in skin problems I described earlier? The modern beauty habits&#x2014;including our overall obsession with grooming&#x2014;that are supposed to be taking care of the skin in the first place! <br> &nbsp;<br> This book isn&#x2019;t another beauty or how-to guide. It&#x2019;s a diagnosis grounded in the latest science that suggests the way we&#x2019;ve been taking care of our skin is wrong. As a practising dermatologist, every day I encounter people with major skin reactions. They tend to be astonished when they discover that they may be causing the issue themselves&#x2014;with a skincare product or the way they wash and take care of their skin. <br> &nbsp;<br> This book amounts to an objective examination of current beauty and skincare practices, by a medical doctor who&#x2019;s been on the front lines of the battle for skin health for 20 years. The volume you hold in your hands details the latest dermatological science, cutting-edge microbiology and my insider&#x2019;s perspective on the beauty industry to argue that, rather than putting the skin into a cycle of damage and repair&#x2014;<i>damaging </i>with soap, cleansers and treatments, <i>repairing </i>with creams and balms&#x2014;maybe it&#x2019;s better just to sidestep that cycle. To <i>minimize </i>such interventions and experience a return to skin health. <br> &nbsp;<br> The approaches described in this book can help with the following conditions:<br> � Atopic eczema<br> � Dandruff<br> � Dermatitis<br> � Dry hands<br> � Dryness or cracking <br> � Psoriasis<br> � Reactions to personal-care products<br> � Rosacea<br> � Sensitive scalp<br> � Sensitive skin<br><br>But even if you don&#x2019;t suffer from any of these conditions, the principles I outline can help you maintain skin health, fight aging and enhance beauty long into your fifties, sixties, seventies and beyond. I&#x2019;ve seen many middle-aged women and men who&#x2019;ve struggled for decades with reactive skin. Teenagers spending hundreds of dollars to treat blotchy redness. Elderly people who&#x2019;ve tried everything to control their dry, itchy skin. And they&#x2019;ve all improved substantially once they&#x2019;ve used my approach. Finally, if you just want to understand what is good or bad for your skin from a dermatologist who specializes in ingredients, read this book. The answers will surprise you.<br> &nbsp;<br> One way to think of it is paleo skincare. Another way? Common sense. However you frame it in your own head, once you&#x2019;ve read this book, you&#x2019;ll spend less money on your skin&#x2014;and it&#x2019;ll look and feel better.</p><h2>Down From The Mountain: The Life and Death of a Grizzly Bear</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Andrews&#x2019;s wonderful </b><i><b>Down from the Mountain</b></i><b> is deeply informed by personal experience and made all the stronger by his compassion and measured thoughts . . .

Their range is diminished, but they&#x2019;re spreading across the West again. Descending into valleys where once they were king, bears find the landscape they&#x2019;d known for eons utterly changed by the new most dominant animal: humans. As the grizzlies approach, the people of the region are wary, at best, of their return.<br> &nbsp;<br> In searing detail, award-winning writer, Montana rancher, and conservationist Bryce Andrews tells us about one such grizzly. Millie is a typical mother: strong, cunning, fiercely protective of her cubs. But raising those cubs&#x2014;a challenging task in the best of times&#x2014;becomes ever harder as the mountains change, the climate warms, and people crowd the valleys. There are obvious dangers, like poachers, and subtle ones as well, like the corn field that draws her out of the foothills and sets her on a path toward trouble and ruin.<br> &nbsp;<br> That trouble is where Bryce&#x2019;s story intersects with Millie&#x2019;s. It is the heart of&nbsp;<i>Down from the Mountain</i>, a singular drama evoking a much larger one: an entangled, bloody collision between two species in the modern West, where the shrinking wilds force man and bear into ever closer proximity.</p><p>BRYCE ANDREWS&#x2019;s debut, <i>Badluck Way</i>, was the 2014 winner of the Barnes &amp; Nobel Discover Great New Writers Award, the 2014 Reading the West Book Award for nonfiction, the 2014 High Plains Book Award for both nonfiction and debut book, and a finalist for the 2014 Washington State Book Award. Born in 1983 and raised in Seattle, Washington, Bryce Andrews migrated east toward the American West. Having spent a decade in the high valleys of Montana, he remains fascinated by the complex and reciprocal relationship between humans, wild animals, and place.<b>Praise for <i>Down from the Mountain</i></b><br><b>Grand Prize Winner of the Banff Mountain Book Competition<br> A <i>Literary Hub</i> Most Anticipated Title of 2019</b><br><b>An EcoWatch Best Book of April </b><br><b>A <i>Missoulian</i> Best Book of April</b><br><b>A <i>Chicago Review of Books</i> Best Book of April</b><br><br> "The two sides of Bryce Andrews &#x2014; enlightened rancher and sensitive writer &#x2014; appear to make a smooth fit...Precise and evocative prose."<br> &#x2014;<b><i>Washington Post</i></b><br><br> "Andrews&#x2019;s writing about wilderness is much like that of&nbsp;author Rick Bass, who displays&nbsp;both a healthy reverence for ecology and an easy way of talking about it.

It&#x2019;s about the tightrope bears walk between living in their mountainous territory, consuming&nbsp;pine nuts, army cutworm moths, and winterkill, versus coming down the mountain to scavenge in human territory.

This five-years counseling gap allows more than enough time for the mortal wounding of a marriage. The First Years of Forever closes the gap by providing much needed, but hard to obtain, counseling for engaged or newly married couples. It is written as a marriage handbook to be read and then referred to again and again. Dr. Ed Wheat, co-author of the best-selling Love Life for Every Married Couple, draws on his training and experiences as a family physician and certified sex therapist to prepare couples for their lifelong journey together. The First Years of Forever provides the practical wisdom most people have to learn the hard way -- or not at all. It tells how to develop skills in communicating with each other and resolving conflicts. And most important, it demonstrates the difference Jesus Christ can make in the quality of marriage.</p></p><p>The late Ed Wheat, M.D., collaborated on a number of books with Gloria Okes Perkins.

The wolverine comes marked with a reputation based on myth and fancy. Yet this enigmatic animal is more complex than the legends that surround it. With a shrinking wilderness and global warming, the future of the wolverine is uncertain.&nbsp;<i>The Wolverine Way</i>&nbsp;reveals the natural history of this species and the forces that threaten its future, engagingly told by Douglas Chadwick, who volunteered with the Glacier Wolverine Project. This five-year study in Glacier National Park - which involved dealing with blizzards, grizzlies, sheer mountain walls, and other daily challenges to survival - uncovered key missing information about the wolverine's habitat, social structure and reproduction habits. Wolverines, according to Chadwick, are the land equivalent of polar bears in regard to the impacts of global warming. The plight of wolverines adds to the call for wildlife corridors that connect existing habitat that is proposed by the Freedom to Roam coalition.</p><p>A wildlife biologist who studied mountain goats and grizzlies in the Rockies, Doug Chadwick began writing about natural history and conservation for national magazines. On assignments from Siberia to the Congo River&#39;s headwaters, he has produced several hundred popular articles and ten books. He is also the vice chair of the board of Vital Ground, a nonprofit land trust that has helped safeguard more than 600,000 acres of wildlife habitat in Alaska, Canada, and the western US.an astonishing account of these fearless, indefatigable<br>and highly intelligent animals and the equally fearless and indefatigable scientists and volunteers who study them. . . a book full of adventure, courage and determination<b>.</b>&nbsp;--Jane Goodall, PhD, DBE Founder - the Jane Goodall Institute &amp; UN Messenger of Peace<br><br>"Is there an animal that embodies the spirit of wildness more than the wolverine?<b>&nbsp;</b>Chadwick's account of these remarkable creatures and the people who study them expresses the environmental crossroads that the wolverine -- and all of us -- stand at<b>.&nbsp;</b>It should make every person stop and think about how much we would be losing should the wolverine not survive the many challenges it faces."&nbsp;-- H.

Beliefs and values are challenged at every turn. But Christians need not slip into the morass of easy relativism. David Horner restores sanity to the collegiate experience with this guide to thinking and flourishing as a Christian. Carefully exploring how ideas work, he gives you essential tools for thinking contextually, thinking logically and thinking worldviewishly. Here Horner meets you where faith and reason intersect and explores how to handle doubts, with an eye toward not just thinking clearly but also living faithfully. This is the book every college freshman needs to read. Don&#39;t leave home without it.</p><p>"More than just enabling you to sidestep the many pitfalls awaiting young Christians who enter academia, <em>Mind Your Faith</em> will equip you to flourish at the university in your mind, faith, and character. The clarity with which David Horner envisions a thoughtful Christian presence in the university's marketplace of ideas is what will make this an essential read for my four children before leaving high school." (Brent Cunningham, Teaching Pastor, Timberline Church, Fort Collins, CO)<br><br>"There are many excellent books on the subject of preparing students for college, but few written with the same passion, clarity and genuine concern for the life of the mind of a college student. David Horner's <em>Mind Your Faith</em> helps us understand the delicate relationship between faith and reason; that behavior follows belief and doctrine informs duty. Parents, this is the best high school graduation gift you can give to your student. Student, this is a must-read because there's simply too much at risk. Lose faith, lose your mind, and vice versa. Neither of which is good." (Harry Edwards, founder and director of Apologetics.com, Inc.)<br><br>"Many Christians heading off to college are simply unprepared for the intellectual, spiritual and moral challenges that await them. Confronted with new ideas, strong desires and relational pressures, it's not surprising that so many drift away from their childhood faith. But it doesn't have to be this way! In this timely book, David Horner offers students a compelling vision of what it means to follow Jesus Christ with a mature faith during the college years and beyond. High school graduates need to read this book!" (Jonathan Morrow, author of Welcome to College and founder of www.thinkchristianly.org)<br><br>"This is the book I have been waiting for. <em>Mind Your Faith</em> is a much-needed resource to help young people flourish as followers of Jesus in the university. I wish I had this book before I went to college! I will be personally recommending this to the many students I get to work with every day." (Sean McDowell, educator, speaker and author of Ethix: Being Bold in a Whatever World)<br><br>"Secular universities have not only forfeited the mission of building students' wisdom, faith and character, they often work in ways contrary to these goals. David Horner offers sage advice, drawn from personal and professional experience, about how Christian students can recognize and counter these challenges and emerge from the college experience as wise Christ-followers. Parents of university-bound students should buy two copies: one for their student and one for themselves." (Steve Wilkens, professor of philosophy, Azusa Pacific University, and author of Hidden Worldviews)<br><br>"Medieval cartographers, mapping the college years, might well have warned, 'Here be dragons!' David Horner knows the territory--and how to tame the dragons--and has offered us a wonderful guidebook. Based on his extensive experience as a minister to college students and as a college professor, Horner understands the challenges Christian students face as they enter college. But what sets his guidebook apart from many others is his unifying vision of what makes for genuine human flourishing. Mind, faith and character stand or fall together. Any student who follows Horner through these pages will have the tools to flourish in college and emerge with mind, faith and character greatly strengthened. I plan to give this book to several high schoolers I know, and I recommend you do the same." (Garrett J. DeWeese, author of Philosophy Made Slightly Less Difficult and Doing Philosophy as a Christian)<br><br>"How can the development of a faithful mind and a mindful faith lead to a virtuous character? This is not the first question Christian students are likely to ask their university to answer. But it should be. David Horner helps students--young and old--seek an answer that is based on sound reasoning and deep, faithful personal commitment to Christ. May this book live long and prosper, leading believers to thoughtful, faithful and virtuous lives." (James W. Sire, author, The Universe Next Door)<br><br>"The opportunities for a reflective Christian student in the university are nearly endless. <em>Mind your Faith</em> is a captivating resource that will help prospective and current students engage more carefully both with their faith and with the world of the university. Horner's analysis and applications are crystal clear and are born out of decades of experience in the academy. Every Christian student and parent ought to reflect carefully on this book." (Gregory E. Ganssle, Rivendell Institute at Yale)<br><br><em>"Mind Your Faith</em> is a feast of insights about thinking, believing and living well. Page after page one finds warm, personable, intelligent reflections about how to flourish well in the contemporary milieu. Horner provides a unique combination of spiritual formation and Christian thought, and I know of no other book that does this so well. It should be read not only by college students but also by pastors and laypersons who want to flourish with a confident faith for our times." (J. P. Moreland, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Biola University, and author of The God Question)<br><br>"Dr. Horner brings a wealth of experience to this wise and winsome operating manual for godly Christian engagement on the college campus. Colleges and universities shape culture more than any other contemporary institution, and souls are saved or lost there on a daily basis. This clear, incisive and enjoyable book will equip students to develop a Christian orientation to this challenging arena that will serve them not only as they pursue their degrees but also for a lifetime of discipleship unto the Lord Jesus Christ."

His original and suggestive approach opens new doors in the study of comparative philosophy and mysticism.<br><br>Izutsu begins with Ibn 'Arabi, analyzing and isolating the major ontological concepts of this most challenging of Islamic thinkers. Then, in the second part of the book, Izutsu turns his attention to an analysis of parallel concepts of two great Taoist thinkers, Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu. Only after laying bare the fundamental structure of each world view does Izutsu embark, in the final section of the book, upon a comparative analysis. Only thus, he argues, can he be sure to avoid easy and superficial comparisons. Izutsu maintains that both the Sufi and Taoist world views are based on two pivots&#x2015;the Absolute Man and the Perfect Man&#x2015;with a whole system of oncological thought being developed between these two pivots. Izutsu discusses similarities in these ontological systems and advances the hypothesis that certain patterns of mystical and metaphysical thought may be shared even by systems with no apparent historical connection. <br><br>This second edition of <i>Sufism and Taoism</i> is the first published in the United States. The original edition, published in English and in Japan, was prized by the few English-speaking scholars who knew of it as a model in the field of comparative philosophy. Making available in English much new material on both sides of its comparison, <i>Sufism and Taoism</i> richly fulfills Izutsu's motivating desire "to open a new vista in the domain of comparative philosophy."</p><p>"Professor Izutsu's work is a pioneering attempt to bring into focus the shareable philosophical concerns of two seemingly unrelated landmarks into religious thought. His method is suggestive, interpretation new and bold, and material used important for further research. His book is useful to students of comparative religion, philosophy of religion, cultural anthropology, Asian thought and religion, and Islamic and Taoist studies."&#x2015;Tu Wei-ming<br><br>"[This book] carries out a comparison in depth between Islamic and Chinese thought for the first time in modern scholarship. . . .

With their broad canvas and large cast of fictional and historical characters, the novels in this series present a panorama of the American political and imperial experience as interpreted by one of its most worldly, knowing, and ironic observers.<br><br>The centennial of the United States was celebrated with great fanfare--fireworks, exhibitions, pious calls to patriotism, and perhaps the most underhanded political machination in the country's history: the theft of the presidency from Samuel Tilden in favor of Rutherford B. Hayes. This was the Gilded Age, when robber barons held the purse strings of the nation, and the party in power was determined to stay in power. Gore Vidal's <b>1876</b> gives us the news of the day through the eyes of Charlie Schuyler, who has returned from exile to regain a lost fortune and arrange a marriage into New York society for his widowed daughter. And although Tammany Hall has faltered and Boss Tweed has fled, the effects of corruption reach deep, even into Schuyler's own family.</p><p>The more things change, the more they stay the same: "The last few days would have brought down any parliamentary government. As it is, the Grant Administration is a shambles, and there is even talk that the President may resign."<p> Charles Schuyler, the narrator of <i>Burr</i>, returns to the United States after an absence of nearly 40 years, with his widowed daughter, Emma, in tow. While they try to find a suitably rich husband for Emma among the New York social set, Charles concentrates on the scandals in Washington--including accusations of corruption and obstruction of justice against Ulysses S. Grant--and the presidential race between Rutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel Tilden (Tilden apparently, in fact, <i>won</i> the election, only to have it taken away because of electoral fraud). Cameo appearances by Chester A. Arthur, Mark Twain, Charles Nordhoff, and others enliven the proceedings. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>"Suspenseful and extravagantly decorated. . . .

The Bible, Talmud, and Midrash refer to many such strange creatures. In this beautifully designed and richly illustrated book, Natan Slifkin, the famed "zoo rabbi" and author of <i>Seasons of Life</i>, <i>Nature's Song</i>, and <i>The Challenge of Creation</i>, examines a host of mythic and not so mythic creatures from both their Torah descriptions and modern zoological research, giving us a new perspective on the interface between science, myth, and Torah thought. Greatly expanding on a prior book, <i>Mysterious Creatures</i>, Rabbi Slifkin explores conflicts between the Talmud and science in the context of Torah mysteries of zoology. The Talmud and Midrash discuss a wide range of bizarre creatures, including mermaids, unicorns, griffins, dragons, sea-serpents and phoenixes, as well as strange biological concepts such as spontaneous generation. <i>Sacred Monsters</i> discusses these cases in detail and brings a range of different approaches for understanding them. It is an essential book for any student or educator who has ever struggled with conflicts between the Talmud and science. Strikingly designed, and including extraordinary photographs and illustrations, this is a truly stimulating work. The goal of this book is not merely to persuade readers that the Talmud and Midrash are worthy of their interest. It is important to discuss these creatures for the same reason that the Sages of the Talmud and Torah scholars throughout the ages saw fit to discuss them &amp;emdash; namely, that they are also part of Torah. Torah is not just about history, religious ritual and laws of interpersonal conduct. It is an extremely broad field of study that encompasses many different topics. Some areas of the Torah are more popular or more relevant than others, but we should not neglect the others. The animals of this book are discussed in classical Jewish literature for a variety of reasons. With some, such as the tachash, it is a matter of understanding the construction of the Tabernacle. With others, such as the mermaid, the goal is to clarify a matter of law. And with yet others, such as Leviathan, the point is to convey various theological messages. Furthermore, there is a particular pressing need for a book of this nature. When people encounter references to such creatures in the Talmud, they can be left with anything from gnawing questions to a severe crisis of faith. Did such creatures really exist? Did the Sages of the Talmud really believe in such creatures? What are we to make of it? This book studies the history of the various approaches that have traditionally been taken by Torah scholars in resolving such issues.</p><p>Born in Manchester, England, Rabbi Natan Slifkin studied there at Yeshivas Shaarei Torah. He then moved to Israel, where he spent many years in study, at Yeshivas Midrash Shmuel and the Mir Yeshivah. He then taught Talmud and Jewish philosophy at Ohr Somayach Institutions, where he received ordination, and now teaches an extensive Zoo Torah course at Yeshivat Lev HaTorah and Midreshet Moriah Seminary for Women. Rabbi Slifkin has written extensively for the Daf Yomi Advancement Forum and many newspapers, websites and journals. He has been invited as guest lecturer to Bar Ilan University and to numerous synagogues worldwide. Several years ago, Rabbi Slifkin began teaching about the relationship between Judaism and the animal kingdom at the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo. He then developed the Zoo Torah program, which he has since successfully operated in New York, Detroit, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Baltimore, St. Louis, Atlanta, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Diego. This program has led Rabbi Slifkin to be featured in television and radio shows as well as in countless newspapers and journals. Rabbi Slifkin has a lifelong fascination with wildlife and has kept a wide variety of exotic pets, including iguanas and tarantulas! His studies of wildlife have led him hiking extensively in Israel, scuba diving to coral reefs in Eilat, on safari in Kenya, whale-watching in California, and behind the scenes at numerous zoological facilities worldwide.Rabbi Natan Slifkin's new book, <i>Sacred Monsters</i>, is a very impressive work, combining exceptionally broad scholarship in such varied fields as science, classical literature, and the Jewish tradition. It provides fascinating insights into the literature of legendary creatures and their possible origins. In this particular book, the author has managed to avoid the many pitfalls awaiting anyone treating the intersection between science and Torah. --Professor Yehudah Leo Levi, Rector Emeritus, Jerusalem College of Technology, Author, <i>Torah and Science</i><br><br>Rabbi Natan Slifkin's newest book is a delightful mix of Talmudic teachings, zoological science, and historical investigations. Anyone who ever doubted the comprehensiveness of our Torah will now be convinced that <i>kulah bah</i> -- there is a place in it even for 'sacred monsters.' Rabbi Slifkin is to be commended for once again offering us a work which answers questions, informs, and, in this case, even entertains. --Rabbi Dr. Tzvi Hersh Weinreb, Executive Vice President, The Orthodox Union<br><br>References in the Talmud and Midrash to curious zoological phenomena are often more mystifying than the creatures themselves. Rabbi Slifkin's thorough scholarship, so well proven in his previous works, comes through once again. Even more important than providing answers to thorny questions surrounding the subjects of the book's title, this work helps the student plot a steady course through the sometimes churning waters of the Sages' science. How much did they rely on the science of their day? When did they--and when did they not--mean to be taken literally? Rabbi Slifkin provides answers consistent with the spirit of our <i>mesorah</i>. By doing so, the profundity of the Torah of our Sages shines with even greater brilliance. --Rabbi Yitzchok Adlerstein, Author, <i>Maharal: Be'er HaGolah</i><br><br>References in the Talmud and Midrash to curious zoological phenomena are often more mystifying than the creatures themselves.

What makes one box of cereal better for you than another, and how are we supposed to decipher the extensive lists of mysterious ingredients on every package, and then determine whether they are safe or toxic to your family's health? With nearly 40,000 items populating the average supermarket today, the Rich Food Poor Food - Grocery Purchasing System (GPS), is a unique guide that steers the consumer through the grocery store aisles, directing them to health enhancing Rich Food options while avoiding health detracting Poor Food ones.<br><br>Rich Food, Poor Food is unique in the grocery store guide arena in that rather than rating a particular food using calories, sodium, or fat as the main criteria, it identifies the products that contain wholesome, micronutrient-rich ingredients that health-conscious shoppers are looking for, like wild caught fish, grass-fed beef, raw/organic cheese, organic meats, pastured eggs and dairy, organic produce and sprouted grains, nuts and seeds, while avoiding over 150 common unwanted Poor Food ingredients such as sugar, high fructose corn syrup, refined flour, GMOs, MSG, artificial colors, flavors and sweeteners, pesticides, nitrites/ nitrates, gluten, and chemical preservatives like BHA and BHT.<br><br>So while other food swapping grocery guides may give the green light to eating Kellogg's Fruit Loops with Sprinkles, Oscar Mayer Turkey Bologna and Hostess Twinkies based on their lower calories, sodium, and/or fat levels, you won't find these heavily processed, food-like products identified as Rich Food choices in Rich Food, Poor Food. That doesn't mean this guide to micronutrient-sufficient living leads readers to a boring culinary lifestyle. Quite the contrary! The Caltons offer Rich Food choices in every aisle of the store including desserts, snacks, sauces, hot dogs, and other fun foods!<br><br>This indispensable grocery store guide raises the bar on food quality as it takes readers on an aisle-by-aisle tour, teaching them how to identify potentially problematic ingredients, while sharing tips on how to lock in a food's nutritional value during preservation and preparation, save money, and make homemade versions of favorite grocery store staples. Regardless of age, dietary preference or current health, Rich Food, Poor Food turns the grocery store and farmer's market into a micronutrient pharmacy--filling the shopping cart with a natural prescription for better health and longevity.</p><p>Mira Calton, CN is a Licensed Certified Nutritionist, a Fellow of the American Association of Integrative Medicine, Diplomate of the College of Clinical Nutrition, a Certified Personal Fitness Chef and is Board Certified in Integrative Health.

But one year, while my wife and I were on vacation, I was reading an international best seller in the thriller genre that had been recommended in a magazine by another world famous author. The problem &#x2013; I kept thinking to myself, <i>I can write a better novel than this</i>. It was approximately a year later, now out of the Marine Corps, that I finally put digital ink to virtual paper, putting my money where my mind was after a year of talking and obsessing about it. It was really that simple &#x2013; I had a vision, made a decision, and put it into action. Once I started, I couldn&#x2019;t stop. Considering how fortunate I am to be in this position today, it was definitely the right choice. </p> <p><strong>Christopher Reich: What was it like writing your first novel? </strong></p> <p><strong>Matthew Betley: </strong> An emotionally brutal roller coaster. From the very first rough draft &#x2013; which you saw and gave me great and harsh feedback on &#x2013; to getting an agent, to receiving a book deal with Emily Bestler Books at Atria, it was nothing short of a series of highs and lows, with near deals, constant rejections, and a nomad-like journey wandering in the publishing wilderness, wondering if it would ever happen. I would tell anyone who wishes to become an author that no matter what, you have to have the thickest skin possible and get used to rejection. I remember reading that you have a better chance of winning the lottery than getting a book published with a major publisher as an unknown author. But based on initial beta reader feedback, I persevered because I believed I had a product people would want to read. </p> <p><strong>Christopher Reich: What authors influenced you the most? </strong></p> <p><strong>Matthew Betley: </strong> Easy &#x2013; Matthew Reilly. I read <i>Ice Station</i> when I was a junior officer in the Marine Corps in 2000. His pacing, the intimacy of the action &#x2013; especially in his first novel &#x2013; and the scope of his settings were original, making it nearly impossible to put Ice Station down&#x2013; or any of his books, for that matter. For me, it&#x2019;s what the genre should be. </p> <p><strong>Christopher Reich: How much of Overwatch stems from your own personal experiences in the Marine Corps? </strong></p> <p><strong>Matthew Betley: </strong> We have a saying &#x2013; &#x201c;You can take the man out of the Marine Corps, but you can never take the Marine Corps out of the man.&#x201d; Like my main character, Logan West, I am a former Marine officer, and all-too-briefly commanded a scout sniper platoon as a young and inexperienced lieutenant. I&#x2019;m also a recovering alcoholic, as well as extremely sarcastic. (You have to have a sense of humor in today&#x2019;s age.) However, while I had a significant amount of tactical training as a junior officer, my deployments were in a staff support function. (Unfortunately, incoming rockets and mortars don&#x2019;t care about your exact function.) The locations, settings, military units, and certain narrative components are all very real, but the overall story is completely my own. </p> <p><strong>Christopher Reich: How likely is something like this to happen? </strong></p> <p><strong>Matthew Betley: </strong>The world is a much darker and more dangerous place than it was when I was getting out of the Marine Corps in 2009. These are strange times. So to answer your question &#x2013; anything is possible. Less global stability creates more opportunities for bad guys of all backgrounds to wreak havoc, both here and abroad. Still, while I wanted to create a realistic setting and origin story for Logan West and friends, my universe is definitely distinct from reality in that my version of our leaders will always make the hard, right decisions when needed. </p> <p><strong>Christopher Reich: What are your plans for the future of Logan West? </strong></p> <p><strong>Matthew Betley: </strong> When I started writing Overwatch, I had plans for three Logan West Thrillers. My intent was for each novel to be a self-contained story inside a larger story arc. I&#x2019;ve actually just finished First Shot - book two of the series out in 2017 - which takes the overarching plot much further down the proverbial tracks. I&#x2019;m about to start writing book three, which is outlined in my head, and I know where book four &#x2013; and possibly five &#x2013; is going. Beyond that, if the readers will have me, I&#x2019;ll continue to write. In the end, it&#x2019;s all about them. </p>Matthew Betley is a former Marine officer of ten years.

He was born in Coventry, raised in Birmingham, and now lives in New York. It is said one of his novels featuring his hero Jack Reacher is sold somewhere in the world every nine seconds. His books consistently achieve the number-one slot on bestseller lists around the world and have sold over one hundred million copies. Two blockbusting Jack Reacher movies have been made so far. He is the recipient of many awards, most recently the CWA&#39;s Diamond Dagger for a writer of an outstanding body of crime fiction, the International Thriller Writers&#39; ThrillerMaster, and the Theakstons Old Peculier Outstanding Contribution to Crime Fiction Award.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>JACK REACHER ORDERED espresso, double, no peel, no cube, foam cup, no china, and before it arrived at his table he saw a man's life change forever. Not that the waiter was slow. Just that the move was slick. So slick, Reacher had no idea what he was watching. It was just an urban scene, repeated everywhere in the world a billion times a day: A guy unlocked a car and got in and drove away. That was all.<br><br>But that was enough.<br><br>The espresso had been close to perfect, so Reacher went back to the same cafe&#x17d; exactly -twenty--four hours later. Two nights in the same place was unusual for Reacher, but he figured great coffee was worth a change in his routine. The caf� was on the west side of Sixth Avenue in New York City, in the middle of the block between Bleecker and Houston. It occupied the ground floor of an undistinguished -four--story building. The upper stories looked like anonymous rental apartments. The cafe itself looked like a transplant from a back street in Rome. Inside it had low light and scarred wooden walls and a dented chrome machine as hot and long as a locomotive, and a counter. Outside there was a single line of metal tables on the sidewalk behind a low canvas screen. Reacher took the same end table he had used the night before and chose the same seat. He stretched out and got comfortable and tipped his chair up on two legs. That put his back against the cafe's outside wall and left him looking east, across the sidewalk and the width of the avenue. He liked to sit outside in the summer, in New York City. Especially at night. He liked the electric darkness and the hot dirty air and the blasts of noise and traffic and the manic barking sirens and the crush of people. It helped a lonely man feel connected and isolated both at the same time.<br><br>He was served by the same waiter as the night before and ordered the same drink, double espresso in a foam cup, no sugar, no spoon. He paid for it as soon as it arrived and left his change on the table. That way he could leave exactly when he wanted to without insulting the waiter or bilking the owner or stealing the china. Reacher always arranged the smallest details in his life so he could move on at a split second's notice. It was an obsessive habit. He owned nothing and carried nothing. Physically he was a big man, but he cast a small shadow and left very little in his wake.<br><br>He drank his coffee slowly and felt the night heat come up off the sidewalk. He watched cars and people. Watched taxis flow north and garbage trucks pause at the curbs. Saw knots of strange young people heading for clubs. Watched girls who had once been boys totter south. Saw a blue German sedan park on the block. Watched a compact man in a gray suit get out and walk north. Watched him thread between two sidewalk tables and head inside to where the cafe staff was clustered in back. Watched him ask them questions.<br><br>The guy was medium height, not young, not old, too solid to be called wiry, too slight to be called heavy. His hair was gray at the temples and cut short and neat. He kept himself balanced on the balls of his feet. His mouth didn't move much as he talked. But his eyes did. They flicked left and right tirelessly. The guy was about forty, Reacher guessed, and furthermore Reacher guessed he had gotten to be about forty by staying relentlessly aware of everything that was happening around him. Reacher had seen the same look in elite infantry veterans who had survived long jungle tours.<br><br>Then Reacher's waiter turned suddenly and pointed straight at him. The compact man in the gray suit stared over. Reacher stared back, over his shoulder, through the window. Eye contact was made. Without breaking it the man in the suit mouthed <i>thank you</i> to the waiter and started back out the way he had entered. He stepped through the door and made a right inside the low canvas screen and threaded his way down to Reacher's table. Reacher let him stand there mute for a moment while he made up his mind. Then he said "Yes," to him, like an answer, not a question.<br><br>"Yes what?" the guy said back.<br><br>"Yes whatever," Reacher said. "Yes I'm having a pleasant evening, yes you can join me, yes you can ask me whatever it is you want to ask me."<br><br>The guy scraped a chair out and sat down, his back to the river of traffic, blocking Reacher's view.<br><br>"Actually I do have a question," he said.<br><br>"I know," Reacher said. "About last night."<br><br>"How did you know that?" The guy's voice was low and quiet and his accent was flat and clipped and British.<br><br>"The waiter pointed me out," Reacher said. "And the only thing that distinguishes me from his other customers is that I was here last night and they weren't."<br><br>"You're certain about that?"<br><br>"Turn your head away," Reacher said. "Watch the traffic."<br><br>The guy turned his head away. Watched the traffic.<br><br>"Now tell me what I'm wearing," Reacher said.<br><br>"Green shirt," the British guy said. "Cotton, baggy, cheap, doesn't look new, sleeves rolled to the elbow, over a green T-shirt, also cheap and not new, a little tight, untucked over -flat--front khaki chinos, no socks, English shoes, pebbled leather, brown, not new, but not very old either, probably expensive. Frayed laces, like you pull on them too hard when you tie them. Maybe indicative of a -self--discipline obsession."<br><br>"OK," Reacher said.<br><br>"OK what?"<br><br>"You notice things," Reacher said. "And I notice things. We're two of a kind. We're peas in a pod. I'm the only customer here now who was also here last night. I'm certain of that. And that's what you asked the staff. Had to be. That's the only reason the waiter would have pointed me out."<br><br>The guy turned back.<br><br>"Did you see a car last night?" he asked.<br><br>"I saw plenty of cars last night," Reacher said. "This is Sixth Avenue."<br><br>"A Mercedes Benz. Parked over there." The guy twisted again and pointed on a slight diagonal at a length of empty curb by a fire hydrant on the other side of the street.<br><br>Reacher said, "Silver, four-door sedan, an S-420, New York vanity plates starting OSC, a lot of city miles on it. Dirty paint, scuffed tires, dinged rims, dents and scrapes on both bumpers."<br><br>The guy turned back again.<br><br>"You saw it," he said.<br><br>"It was right there," Reacher said. "Obviously I saw it."<br><br>"Did you see it leave?"<br><br>Reacher nodded. "Just before eleven -forty--five a guy got in and drove it away."<br><br>"You're not wearing a watch."<br><br>"I always know what time it is."<br><br>"It must have been closer to midnight."<br><br>"Maybe," Reacher said. "Whatever."<br><br>"Did you get a look at the driver?"<br><br>"I told you, I saw him get in and drive away."<br><br>The guy stood up.<br><br>"I need you to come with me," he said. Then he put his hand in his pocket. "I'll buy your coffee."<br><br>"I already paid for it."<br><br>"So let's go."<br><br>"Where?"<br><br>"To see my boss."<br><br>"Who's your boss?"<br><br>"A man called Lane."<br><br>"You're not a cop," Reacher said. "That's my guess. Based on observation."<br><br>"Of what?"<br><br>"Your accent. You're not American. You're British. The NYPD isn't that desperate."<br><br>"Most of us are Americans," the British guy said. "But you're right, we're not cops. We're private citizens."<br><br>"What kind?"<br><br>"The kind that will make it worth your while if you give them a description of the individual who drove that car away."<br><br>"Worth my while how?"<br><br>"Financially," the guy said. "Is there any other way?"<br><br>"Lots of other ways," Reacher said. "I think I'll stay right here."<br><br>"This is very serious."<br><br>"How?"<br><br>The guy in the suit sat down again.<br><br>"I can't tell you that," he said.<br><br>"Goodbye," Reacher said.<br><br>"Not my choice," the guy said. "Mr. Lane made it -mission--critical that nobody knows. For very good reasons."<br><br>Reacher tilted his cup and checked the contents. Nearly gone.<br><br>"You got a name?" he asked.<br><br>"Do you?"<br><br>"You first."<br><br>In response the guy stuck a thumb into the breast pocket of his suit coat and slid out a black leather business card holder. He opened it up and used the same thumb to slide out a single card. He passed it across the table. It was a handsome item. Heavy linen stock, raised lettering, ink that still looked wet. At the top it said: <i>Operational Security Consultants</i>.<br><br>"OSC," Reacher said. "Like the license plate."<br><br>The British guy said nothing.<br><br>Reacher smiled. "You're security consultants and you got your car stolen? I can see how that could be embarrassing."<br><br>The guy said, "It's not the car we're worried about."<br>Lower down on the business card was a name: <i>John Gregory</i>. Under the name was a subscript: <i>British Army, Retired</i>. Then a job title: <i>Executive Vice President</i>.<br><br>"How long have you been out?" Reacher asked.<br><br>"Of the British Army?" the guy called Gregory said. "Seven years."<br><br>"Unit?"<br><br>"SAS."<br><br>"You've still got the look."<br><br>"You too," Gregory said. "How long have you been out?"<br><br>"Seven years," Reacher said.<br><br>"Unit?"<br><br>"U.S. Army CID, mostly."<br><br>Gregory looked up. Interested. "Investigator?"<br><br>"Mostly."<br><br>"Rank?"<br><br>"I don't remember," Reacher said. "I've been a civilian seven years."<br><br>"Don't be shy," Gregory said. "You were probably a lieutenant colonel at least."<br><br>"Major," Reacher said. "That's as far as I got."<br><br>"Career problems?"<br><br>"I had my share."<br><br>"You got a name?"<br><br>"Most people do."<br><br>"What is it?"<br><br>"Reacher."<br><br>"What are you doing now?"<br><br>"I'm trying to get a quiet cup of coffee."<br><br>"You need work?"<br><br>"No," Reacher said. "I don't."<br><br>"I was a sergeant," Gregory said.<br><br>Reacher nodded. "I figured. SAS guys usually are. And you've got the look."<br><br>"So will you come with me and talk to Mr. Lane?"<br><br>"I told you what I saw. You can pass it on."<br><br>"Mr. Lane will want to hear it direct."<br><br>Reacher checked his cup again. "Where is he?"<br><br>"Not far. Ten minutes."<br><br>"I don't know," Reacher said. "I'm enjoying my espresso."<br><br>"Bring it with you. It's in a foam cup."<br><br>"I prefer peace and quiet."<br><br>"All I want is ten minutes."<br><br>"Seems like a lot of fuss over a stolen car, even if it was a Mercedes Benz."<br><br>"This is not about the car."<br><br>"So what is it about?"<br><br>"Life and death," Gregory said. "Right now more likely death than life."<br><br>Reacher checked his cup again. There was less than a lukewarm -eighth--inch left, thick and scummy with espresso mud. That was all. He put the cup down.<br><br>"OK," he said. "So let's go."</p><h2>Cosmic Cradle, Revised Edition: Spiritual Dimensions of Life before Birth</h2><p>Where was your soul before you were born? If your soul is immortal, did it have a "life" prior to birth? Did you choose your life and parents? Is reincarnation real? Elizabeth and Neil Carman, the authors of <i>Cosmic Cradle, </i>address these questions through interviews with adults and children who report pre-birth experiences (PBEs) <i>not</i> based on regression, hypnosis, or drugs. Instead, interviewees recall their pre-birth existence completely sober and awake.<br><br>In contrast to near-death experiences (NDEs), which have been well documented to show us what the soul experiences after death, PBEs throw light upon our lives before birth. People with NDEs sense that they "return home" when their spirits cross to the other side. What is the nature of this place we "return" to? PBEs suggest that we come from the same place we return to: we come from the Light and return to the Light. The same eternal "you" progresses through life before life, human life, and life after death. <br><br>This new edition of <i>Cosmic Cradle </i>explores your soul's journey into your mother's womb--where your soul comes from, the origin and purpose of your life, and the process by which you entered an earthly body. In pre-birth communications, parents meet a soul seeking to cross over from the heavenly realm to human birth. Persons with pre-birth memories recall existence in a luminous world before birth, in which they preview the upcoming life with a Divine Planner, and recall how they journeyed to their mothers' wombs.<br><br>Contents<br> Foreword by Bernie Siegel, MD<br> Introduction: Amnesia of Our Spiritual Origins<br> Part One: Pre-Birth Memory<br> 1.

Combined, their efforts have spanned into the realms of social work and environmental protection. In the 1970s, Elizabeth Carman worked with minority families and did social service work in adoption and foster care. She later spent years teaching inner development courses and meditation. Prebirth research began in 1989 when she conducted interviews with mothers who were more in touch with their intuition. In 2002, Elizabeth received an honorary PhD for her research published in&nbsp;<i>Cosmic Cradle: Souls Waiting in the Wings for Birth</i>.<br><br>Neil Carman's love of nature led him to obtain advanced degrees including a doctorate in the biological sciences. After a research position opened his eyes to global pollution, he was led to pursue an environmental career. He taught in the biological sciences and also created a new university course on the growing evidence of how meditation techniques unfold our consciousness beyond what is generally recognized."Cosmic Cradle&nbsp;is such an enjoyable read and not just a dry esoteric or academic study. It is a beautifully crafted book with an almost universal appeal.&nbsp;Mothers will love it, fathers will be engrossed by it and grandparents will wonder at the cyclic patterns described by these young children."<br>&#x2014;Peter J.

As the holiday season approaches, the boys and girls continue to play pranks on one another and begin to learn the consequences of their actions. Caroline Malloy and Wally Hatford are partners for their fourth-grade December project and discover that, instead of annoying one another, they need to learn how to work together in order to receive a passing grade. Told in their alternating viewpoints, the story moves quickly, continuing the mischief and humor of the previous novels. Readers will be especially taken with precocious and dramatic Caroline, who will stop at nothing for revenge. While it is not necessary to read the first three books, fans of the series will enjoy references to the characters&#39; past pranks and will delight in the promise of future additions to this ongoing battle between these rivals.</p><p>IT'S DECEMBER, and Christmas is coming, but Caroline Malloy and Wally Hatford aren't singing carols around the tree. Instead, these sworn enemies must interview each other for the dreaded December class project. Caroline, as usual, has a trick up her sleeve that's sure to shock Wally in front of the entire class. That's just the first step in her plan to gross Wally out.<p>In the meantime, Wally and his brothers find a way to spy on the Malloy girls at home. The girls vow to get revenge on those sneaky Hatfords with a trap the boys won't soon forget. To make matters worse, Caroline and Wally are really in for it when the gross-out gifts they mean for each other end up in the most unexpected places. Ho ho ho! You'd better watch out when the Hatfords and Malloys come to town. Readers everywhere will welcome the return of their favorite feuding families.</p><b>Phyllis Reynolds Naylor</b> grew up in Anderson, Indiana, and Joliet, Illinois.

Hemingway's Boat is both stunningly original and deeply gripping, an invaluable contribution to our understanding of this great American writer, published fifty years after his death.</p></p><p><b>Paul Hendrickson</b>&#x2019;s previous book, <i>Sons of Mississippi,</i> won the 2003 National Book Critics Circle Award for nonfiction.

G-men shot an accomplice of Dillinger's in Minnesota; the Nazis were running guns to the Moors; Seminoles were reviving a tribal dance in honor of alligators in Florida; Lou Gehrig had two homers in an exhibition game in Atlanta. And roughly the bottom third of America was out of work.<br><br>According to "Steamship Movements in New York," a column that runs daily in the business section of the <i>Evening Journal</i>, nine liners are to dock today. The SS <i>Paris</i>, 34,500 tons, is just sliding in after a seven-day Atlantic crossing, from Le Havre via Plymouth, at Pier 57 on the West Side of New York City.<br><br>"Expected to dock: 5:00 P.M.," reports the newspaper. And she does.<br><br>If this were a Movietone News item about Hemingway the big-game hunter, arriving home after eight months abroad, and you were in a darkened movie palace of the thirties awaiting the feature, you'd see ropes being thrown off, gangplanks being lowered, steamer trunks being unloaded, and passengers starting gaily to stream off. You'd see the New York press boys with their rumpled suits and stained ties and skinny notebooks and Speed Graphic cameras clawing for position. The blocky white lettering superimposed on the flickering images would announce: "Back from Lion Hunt in East Africa!" They'd bring up the sound track-something stirring, to suggest the march of time. And then would come the voice-over&#x2014;wouldn't it be Ed Herlihy's?&#x2014;with its electric charge: "Famed author Mr. Ernest Hemingway, just back on the French liner<i> Paris</i> with Mrs. Hemingway from conquering the lion and the rhino and the wildebeest and the greater kudu, says that death in the afternoon is far less engrossing in a Spanish bull ring than on the African veldt."<br><br>The press boys clotted at the bottom of the gangplank badly want Hemingway, and they want Katharine Hepburn (she is on the boat, too, and makes wonderful copy, when she deigns to speak), but apparently none of them knows (for none of their papers will have it tomorrow) that an even bigger trophy has just berthed at Pier 57: Marlene Dietrich. She's going to give them the nifty slip. Publicity? Who needs it? Maybe Dietrich's hiding out in her stateroom. She might have registered under a different name-glamorous figures routinely do this. In fact, Hepburn is on the manifest as "Miss Katherine Ludlow." (Her husband is Ludlow Ogden Smith.) <i>She</i> has decided not to hide from the pack.<br><br>The famous and close and long-lasting Dietrich-Hemingway friendship dates from this Atlantic crossing. For the rest of his life, Hemingway mostly called her the Kraut, when he wasn't addressing her as "daughter," the latter being how he liked to address women younger than himself, famous or otherwise, whom he'd not&#x2014;apparently&#x2014;taken to bed. Dietrich was two and a half years younger. There is a well-traveled story about how she was stepping into the ship's dining room to join a dinner party. Every open-jawed man at the table rose to give her his chair, but just as she started to sit down, the international flame with the statuesque body and lusty voice counted the mouths and saw that there were twelve diners. "Oh. I'm the thirteenth. You will excuse me if I don't join you. I'm superstitious about thirteen at dinner," she said, starting to withdraw. But just then Hemingway blocked her way. "Excuse me," he said. "I don't mean to intrude. But I'd be glad to be the fourteenth."<br><br>Afterward, they supposedly strolled the decks arm in arm and told each other-maybe like Bogart and Claude Rains in <i>Casablanca</i>, except that that movie hadn't been made yet-that this was going to be the start of a beautiful friendship. At least this is the legend, and Dietrich herself greatly helped it along in 1955 in a first-person cover story in the Sunday supplement of the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>. The piece was titled "The Most Fascinating Man I Know." She talked of how she and Hemingway had depended on each other through the years, how she'd protected his deeply personal letters to her in a strongbox. Actually, Dietrich may not have even written the piece&#x2014;according to Mary Hemingway, it was ghosted by journalist and scriptwriter A. E. Hotchner, one of Hemingway's last confidants, or toadies, depending on your point of view, for the two-decades-younger Hotch, as Hemingway often called him, has been described as both in the vast, roily, envy-ridden sea of Hemingway studies. In any case, among smaller errors, Dietrich or her ghost got the name of the boat wrong; she said it was the other (even grander) star of the French line, the <i>�le de France</i>.<br><br>But this is a newsreel of the imagination. Hemingway's poised at the <i>Paris</i>'s rail with his spouse. He's intent on purchasing a boat, but right now he's allowing photographs to be made, and he's popping quotes. Freeze the frame. Stop time in a box.<br><br>Pauline Hemingway is in a zebra-striped suit and an almost dowdy hat, curled at the brim, tilting right to left. Her right shoulder touches her husband's left. She is so small beside him. Her hair is cropped like a boy's. She has a boyish physique and is known for her disinclination to use makeup. (It's true she likes to keep her nails and toes manicured for her husband, often lacquering them in light pink.) Her body is turned a few degrees away from the rail, as if she might decide to walk off any second now. She's probably not getting a word in edgewise. She isn't a beautiful woman, but she isn't unattractive, either. She is four years and a day older than her husband, who is leaning forward, right into the middle of things, as if right into the middle of reporters' notebooks. Both his arms are on the rail, and his right hand is holding the brim of a fedora that has a wide, dark band. He's wearing a suit and tie and there's a sliver of handkerchief visible at the top of his vest pocket. No matter his dress, he's unmistakably a man of the outdoors, with the body of an athlete. His hair looks Brylcreemed and newly cut, although a strand or two at the back of his head are out of place. Around his seventeen-and-a-half-inch neck, inside his dress shirt, is a scapular: he's a convert to Catholicism, which is his wife's devoutly practiced faith. (She's a "cradle Catholic," while his on-again, off-again devotions are reputed to have arisen out of the shocks of World War I.) He's known to wear his scapular unfailingly in these years. It's got an image of Christ on it, suspended from a brown, shoestring-like loop. At home, in Key West, friends have observed him with the scapular, and how he'll make the sign of the cross before he goes in swimming.<br><br>That smile: hobnailed and hard-boiled all the way, just this side of aggressive. The more you study the photograph, however, the more you see that both Hemingways are holding a pose.<br><br>This picture, or versions of it, is going to get picked up and run in many hinterland places, including in the Twin Cities of Minnesota, where winter still has the earth in her grip, and where a young, self-styled, Hemingway-like character will see the photograph and tear it out of the <i>Pioneer Press</i> and fold it into his pocket and pack his knapsack and hop a freight to Florida, in hopes of meeting his writing idol. The young man's name is Arnold Morse Samuelson, and he is in for the ride of his life. But that's running out ahead.<br><br>Not every city editor in New York&#x2014;there are something like nine dailies in the city in 1934&#x2014;has sent a reporter to the docks today to shag quotes and to compose deathless passages on deadline about the return of the native. (In the old days of the news business, these pieces were often known as "brights." <i>Go get me a Hemingway bright</i>, some pale, overweight editor at the <i>Times</i> surely growled at a reporter on the city desk.) And what is the "fascinating man" saying to the press boys? He's telling them how he gives first honors to the leopards, "because they strike the fastest." But the lion is such a noble beast, too, he says. "He is not afraid or stupid. He does not want to fight, but sometimes man makes him, and then it is up to the man to shoot his way out of what he has got himself into." With the lion and the leopard, "you're either quick or you're dead. I saw a lion do one hundred yards in three seconds flat, which may give you an idea." The hunter saw ninety-six lions altogether and at one point he photographed twenty-nine lionesses "preening themselves like a group of finishing school girls." He made a moral bargain with himself to bring down only animals that were utter strangers to him; the lions that he'd stalked with his camera he could somehow not force himself to shoot. But now he intends to return to his home in Key West and resume his vocation. His season of intense writing, he hints, may or may not concern Africa.<br><br>The <i>World-Telegram</i> will have a seven-grapher tomorrow, page 11 ("Jungle Praised by Hemingway"). The lead:<br><br>Ernest Hemingway, author . . . is back home and "nearly broke" after eight months abroad, three of which he spent on the "dark continent." The trouble with bull-fighting, in the opinion of the man who admits he knows so little about it that he wrote a book on the subject, is simply that it's too formal. Like all invitation affairs, he holds, it has a plethora of rules. Out in the brush where the hunter fights for a clawhold with his prey as man to beast-and no rules committee in the offing-it's more fun.<br><br>The <i>Herald Tribune</i>'s subhead on its Hemingway bright (eleven paragraphs, page 4): "Author, Back from African Hunt, Says He Never Shot Beasts Trailed for Camera." The lead: "Ernest Hemingway, enthusiastic over the three months he had passed in East Africa stalking big game with rifle and camera, returned yesterday on the French liner Paris with Mrs. Hemingway, who shared his adventures. Mr. Hemingway was in such high spirits that he granted an interview, something unusual for him."<br><br>The subject's first quote: "It's hard to describe just what there is to killing big game. It's very exciting and-uh-it gives you a fine feeling. It's the sort of the same thing as any killing; that is, it's fine, if you do a clean job of it and it's lousy if there's bad sportsmanship." Toward the end: "The pursuit of game having renewed his enthusiasm for life, he returned home 'to work like hell and make enough money so that I can go back to Africa and really learn something about lions.' "<br><br>It must be the <i>Herald Trib</i>'s account that E. B. White of <i>The New Yorker</i> catches on his way to work on the morning of the fourth. The Herald Trib is the highbrow newspaper of choice in Manhattan, and these quotes are apparently just too much for a domesticated literary man. Because the following week, a three-stanza Hemingway send-up titled "The Law of the Jungle" appears on page 31 of <i>The New Yorker</i>. White's final lines:<br><br>And who, in time of darkest danger<br><br>Will only dominate a stranger.<br><br>Seventeen years from now, on the publication of Hemingway's weakest novel, <i>Across the River and into the Trees</i>, White, great American humorist, never a white hunter on the dark continent, will bring down Hemingway again in the magazine with a parody titled "Across the Street and into the Grill." By then parodying Hemingway will have become a cottage sport and pastime in America. White's piece will particularly enrage the author, perhaps because he instantly understands that it will get into anthologies and live way past his own death.<br><br>What was Ernest Hemingway's interior state when he stood at the Paris rail with his petite and affluent spouse on the eve of acquiring <i>Pilar</i>? (Pauline's uncle, Gus Pfeiffer&#x2014;a New York businessman, part of whose fortune had been derived from his interests in a Paris and Manhattan perfumer named Richard Hudnut, and who liked Ernest a good deal, at least then-had staked the safari somewhere to the bottom line of about $30,000. The safari had lasted just a little over two months, not three, as was reported. Hemingway had been in Africa for nearly three months, but not in the bush for that long, and for about a week of the actual safari he was confined to a hospital bed in Nairobi, having suffered an attack of amoebic dysentery that necessitated evacuation by light plane.)<br><br>A whole lot of his state of mind can be glimpsed in his writing, not least his letter writing. Hemingway wrote somewhere between six and seven thousand letters in his life, by hand and by typewriter and by dictation, usually in free-associative bursts, often after a day's writing, to relieve tension, more or less in the way you'd speak in a conversation. This is particularly true of his letters to friends and to certain family members. "The desire to get to the man behind the work can be sometimes overwhelming. I always go back to the letters," Patrick Hemingway told me in 1987, a sentence that seems only truer with time.<br><br>Hemingway's momentary high spirits in early April 1934 must have had at least two prongs: he was back from his excellent safari adventure; and now, before heading home by train to Florida, he hoped to go to a Brooklyn boatyard and put in an order for his own longed-for fishing machine. And yet, what his letters, cojoined with verifiable facts of his life just then, suggest is that what might have seemed so clear in a photograph and in what he told some shipside reporters didn't nearly reflect what Hemingway was generally feeling inside. Every good photograph has a secret, a critic named Mark Stevens once wrote: "Something mysteriously and tantalizingly withheld, even when the world seems laid out as plainly as a corpse upon a table."<br><br>One verifiable truth is that the monarch of American letters had been riding through rough critical seas for the last few years&#x2014;and much more rough going was up ahead. Somehow, nothing seemed quite as locked as it once did, and that included owning the reviewers. Not quite a year earlier&#x2014;on June 13, 1933&#x2014;the author for whom things had once seemed to come so effortlessly had written to his book editor: "I am tempted never to publish another damned thing. The swine arent worth writing for. I swear to Christ they're not. Every phase of the whole racket is so disgusting that it makes you feel like vomiting. . . . And it is a commonplace that I lack confidence that I am a man&#x2014;What shit&#x2014;And I'm supposed to go around with your good friends spreading that behind my back-And they imagine they will get away with it." He'd been referring specifically in this instance to his former friend Max Eastman (a fellow Scribners author), who'd just written a half-joking and belated review of <i>Death in the Afternoon</i> for <i>The New Republic</i> titled "Bull in the Afternoon." The Hemingway style, Eastman said, was that "of wearing false hair on the chest." In Hemingway's reading, and in the reading of some of his close friends, the piece wasn't trying to be humorous at all but rather was making overt suggestions to the effect that Hemingway must feel sexually inadequate. Well, he'd break Eastman's jaw the next time he saw him, and sell tickets to the event.<br><br>One way to read Ernest Hemingway's life is through the phenomenon of remarkable first luck. He'd become an international literary figure, specifically as a novelist, so quickly&#x2014;in the second half of the 1920s, less than a decade from when he'd started out. He'd started out with stories&#x2014;actually, sometimes just intensely felt imagistic fragments of stories.</p><h2>The Ruins of Dantooine (Star Wars: Galaxies)</h2><p><b>Enter the explosive universe of the exciting online game<br><br><i>STAR WARS</i> GALAXIES:<br><i>AN EMPIRE DIVIDED</i>!<br><br></b>It is a time of great turmoil.

Other than that slight patter, the only sound disturbing the evening was the sudden cry of the peko peko. The large, blueskinned reptavian&#x2019;s pitiful squawk carried across the still lake before stopping as suddenly as it had begun.<br><br>&#x201c;The tusk-cats must be hunting,&#x201d; Inquisitor Loam Redge said quietly to himself, smiling at the idea of the sleek, fawn-colored beasts circling the Retreat. Peko pekos weren&#x2019;t the only thing that the large predators could kill; simply the opening course.<br><br>The cloaked human stood alone on the stone balcony overlooking the placid lake and the hills beyond. For the last few moments, he had watched the final glow of the setting sun turn the world a brief, shimmering pink. As soon as the molten ball had disappeared, though, the sky had turned several shades of gray, from dirty white to steel. The colors layered themselves one on top of the other, so it was impossible to discern where one began and another ended. And then the rains had come.<br><br>With a parting glance toward the twinkling lights of Moenia off to the east, the Inquisitor returned inside, where he brushed at his cloaks furiously, as<br>though their exposure to the abrupt shower had somehow sullied them. He smoothed back his rich brown hair and stood with his spine at ramrod attention.<br><br>No one knew how old the Inquisitor was, and Redge preferred it remain that way. There were precious few secrets in the Empire, and he liked to keep as many as he could.<br><br>Inquisitor Loam Redge was one of those rare individuals who derived great pleasure from his work. Finding those sensitive to the Force, torturing them, and destroying them were his topmost priorities, and they also gave him the greatest joy. He was very good at his vocation, and he always looked as though he was enjoying a private joke when he was at his busiest. This twisted happiness had, over time, etched its mark on his face in the<br>form of the faintest crinkles near the outer edges of his dirt-colored eyes. Other than that, his face was mostly unlined. He might have been thirty, he might have been fifty.<br><br>When he was satisfied that he looked properly groomed, Inquisitor Redge moved out into the hallway. He padded silently across the plush, goldtrimmed maroon carpeting that lined the walkway. It was so thick, he barely heard the MSE-6 that almost scurried past his feet. The tiny, black, rectangular droids littered the Emperor&#x2019;s Retreat, as they did so many of the Imperial starships and ground installations throughout the galaxy. When the struggling company Rebaxan Columni had found itself facing imminent bankruptcy, it had offered the Empire a cut-rate deal on millions of them. Because the navy was extremely short on droids, it accepted. Now the Empire was crawling with the little automatons.<br><br>The small droid stopped a few feet beyond the Inquisitor and extended its heavy manipulator arm, clutching a rag. It scrubbed feverishly at some unseen smudge on the tan marble wall. Redge studied the droid for a moment as it buffed the already highly polished surface before slightly raising his cloaks up and moving past it. He found that the mechanism reminded him vaguely of a type of small vermin, and it disturbed him slightly.<br><br>There was no one else in the corridor, and he continued to revel in the quiet luxury of Emperor Palpatine&#x2019;s Retreat on Naboo. The Emperor&#x2019;s homeworld was calmly green, with areas of dense swamps broken up by rolling plains and verdant hills. Redge found the view soothing and knew that Emperor Palpatine had chosen the location for just that effect, not because of any maudlin sense of homeworld loyalty. While he had traveled to Theed, Moenia, Kaadara, Dee&#x2019;ja Peak, and most of the smaller cities on the relatively peaceful planet, Inquisitor Redge had not yet ventured into the streams and canals that honeycombed the interior core of the planet. He had heard from a reliable source that it was possible for one to travel throughout the whole of Naboo and never once stick a head above ground. At some point, he would have to explore the passageways himself, or send a trusted associate in his place. There was no way of knowing just what or who might be hiding down there. Naboo might be a haven not just for artists and architects, but for other, less desirable sorts as well.<br><br>Since establishing the Retreat, the Emperor had had little trouble planetside and seen no sign of the Rebellion, as far as Redge was aware. And Redge made it his business to know. Queen Kylantha had pledged and proven her loyalty many times over to Palpatine. But it irked the Inquisitor that she had not bothered to dissolve the Naboo Royal Advisory Council or to impose any real changes on the democratic structure of the government. If she were truly that loyal, then why hadn&#x2019;t she made the simple and overt gesture of disbanding the mock administration? Was it simply for her vanity, so that she could retain her empty title, or was there more to it? These questions nagged at the Inquisitor during the darkest hours of the night.<br><br>Rounding a corner, Redge arrived at the entrance of a cavernous, domed antechamber, large enoughto hold several garrisons comfortably. Like the hallway that led up to it, the chamber was composed entirely of mottled pink-and-tan marble. Hanging along the walls and from the curved ceiling were banners of maroon and gold, like the rugs that carpeted the myriad hallways in the Retreat. Cylindrical gold lamps hung down, casting shining puddles of light on the polished floor. Along the far wall, two of the Emperor&#x2019;s personal guards, draped entirely in crimson, stood as sentries by the door the Inquisitor knew led to the Emperor&#x2019;s inner sanctum. Like avenging spirits, the guards remained steadfast in their duty, not moving a muscle. However, the vast chamber was not entirely devoid of movement.<br><br>Along the curved wall, near a small computer terminal, two stormtroopers stood. Unlike Redge, these troopers were relaxed in their stance. One eaned casually against the wall&#x2014;no easy feat, given the fact that he was clad from head to toe in sparkling white armor. His colleague held only a slightly more militaristic pose. Neither man faced Redge, so both were unaware of his presence. Gliding over slightly, the Inquisitor could just hear their clipped conversation.<br><br>&#x201c;I tell you,&#x201d; the one against the wall squawked to the other, &#x201c;if they haven&#x2019;t started building a new one yet, they&#x2019;re not going to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only been about a year,&#x201d; the other replied with more static in his response, his transmitter clearly in need of some attention. &#x201c;Equipment that awesome takes time to repair.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you,&#x201d; the first argued, &#x201c;that if they haven&#x2019;t repaired or replaced the Death Star by now, they won&#x2019;t. And that should tell you something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; his comrade responded, and even Redge could hear the unease in the man&#x2019;s mechanized voice.<br><br>The first stormtrooper shifted his stance slightly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard rumors that the Rebellion is growing, becoming more powerful. If they could take out a<br>weapon as great as the Death Star, there&#x2019;s no telling just how strong they really are. I think the Emperor is hiding that from us.&#x201d; His voice had dropped surprisingly low, considering he had to speak through a transmitter. &#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s hiding many things.&#x201d; &#x201c;Talk like that will get you killed,&#x201d; his friend warned him.<br><br>&#x201c;Or worse,&#x201d; Redge added in a gentle, melodic voice.<br><br>Both troopers turned suddenly, clearly caught off guard. That was the technique that Redge enjoyed the most: knock an opponent off balance and strike while he was teetering.<br><br>&#x201c;Sir, I-I didn&#x2019;t know you were here,&#x201d; the first stammered.<br><br>&#x201c;Obviously,&#x201d; Redge replied easily, enjoying the man&#x2019;s apparent discomfort. He decided to let him squirm a moment longer and so remained silent,<br>forcing the trooper to try to dig his way out of his shallow grave.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, sir, I meant no disservice. I was just explaining my concerns to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother trying to explain anything to me, soldier,&#x201d; Redge interrupted coldly. &#x201c;I know exactly what you were trying to explain to your &#x2018;friend&#x2019;<br>here.&#x201d; He nodded to the other man. &#x201c;You feel our Emperor is keeping things from you, keeping you in the dark, so to speak?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just nothing,&#x201d; Redge warned him darkly, his facade of pleasantness a memory. &#x201c;You know all that you need to know and nothing more or less,<br>like the rest of us. To serve the Emperor is to trust in him completely and question nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>The stormtroopers remained silent, and the Inquisitor knew they were both too frightened to speak. That fear warmed his cold heart. The corners of his thin lips twitched in growing pleasure. He relaxed his stance ever so slightly.<br><br>&#x201c;But,&#x201d; he graciously allowed, &#x201c;you do make a good point in your own simplistic fashion.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir?&#x201d; the second soldier asked, and Redge knew they were fishing for anything to redeem themselves.<br><br>&#x201c;The war is far from over,&#x201d; he admitted. &#x201c;We do have the strength and the power to crush the Rebels; that much is obvious. However, the Rebels<br>are devious, and like fanned rawls they have hidden themselves well and fashioned nests and lairs at the highest levels of power. Only when we drive them out and exterminate those hidden in our midst will victory truly be ours,&#x201d; Redge explained, momentarily caught up in his own fervor.<br><br>But before he could pursue the discussion further, he felt an almost imperceptible change in the air pressure of the chamber. The wiry hairs on his<br>arms rose, and Redge knew the Emperor&#x2019;s door had slid open.<br><br>He turned his back on the two stormtroopers, their presence completely inconsequential now, and watched as a black figure separated himself from<br>the impenetrable shadows of the doorway. As the stark figure moved forward, Redge felt his stomach turn and experienced a moment of vertigo. Sensitive as he was to the Force, the Inquisitor was nearly overwhelmed by the power of the man moving toward him.<br><br>The giant figure was covered from head to toe in obsidian armor. On his chest plate, a series of devices blinked blue and red, in time with his breathing and his heartbeat. His face was covered by a grotesque, helmeted breath mask that resembled the skull of some dark god. He moved wiftly yet deliberately toward the Inquisitor, his black cape billowing behind him. He looked like nothing so much as a winged bird of prey.<br><br>Redge vaguely saw, from the corner of his eyes, that the troopers snapped even straighter at the ominous presence than they had for him. He didn&#x2019;t<br>notice much more as he sank gracefully to one knee in a deep, obsequious bow.<br><br>&#x201c;My Lord Vader,&#x201d; he whispered with just the right amount of reverence.<br><br>&#x201c;Rise, Inquisitor,&#x201d; Lord Vader ordered in a deep, rich voice, his orders punctuated by his unmistakable mechanized breathing. &#x201c;Rise and walk with me.&#x201d;<br><br>Redge rose as gracefully as he had knelt and resisted the urge to shake out his cloaks yet again, refusing to appear foppish before a Dark Lord of the<br>Sith. He stretched his back even straighter, but still had to look up at the Sith Lord who stood two meters tall. Before he moved with Vader, however, he turned to face the two soldiers.<br><br>&#x201c;Since you both have so much free time on your hands to reflect, I will see about relocating you to a post that you will undoubtedly find more . . . challenging,&#x201d; he told them. &#x201c;Perhaps something in the Hoth system,&#x201d; he mused. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe we have sent many satellites out there yet. Report to your garrison commander for new orders. Your tour of duty here is now over.&#x201d; With that, he turned and marched alongside Lord Vader, briefly contemplating what hellish location they would eventually be dispatched to.<br><br>After a few moments of silence that were distinctly uncomfortable for Redge, he addressed the dark shadow. &#x201c;Yes, my lord?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Emperor wishes to know how you are progressing,&#x201d; Lord Vader demanded.<br><br>Redge struggled to keep his equilibrium. The dark power of the Force rolled off Vader in crashing waves.<br><br>&#x201c;Inquisitor?&#x201d; the distorted voice demanded, and Redge knew he would not ask the question a second time.<br><br>&#x201c;My lord,&#x201d; he began, &#x201c;I understand the seriousness surrounding the nature of the mission.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you? I am honored that you agree with me,&#x201d; Vader replied. Redge thought he could almost hear the sarcasm in the Sith Lord&#x2019;s voice.<br><br>&#x201c;I only meant, Lord Vader, that I fully comprehend my role in this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you, Inquisitor?&#x201d; Vader asked him, stopping just before both men reached another hallway. Only Vader&#x2019;s mechanized breathing could be heard<br>echoing in the antechamber. Redge was momentarily at a loss for how to proceed. Darth Vader was the only creature that ever inspired this effect in the Inquisitor.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you truly know what it will mean,&#x201d; the Sith Lord eventually continued, &#x201c;if the holocron should return to the Rebels&#x2019; hands?&#x201d;<br><br>Redge swallowed hard. &#x201c;Yes, my lord, I think I can appreciate what should happen. If the Rebels manage to retrieve that device&#x2014;with, among other<br>things, its list of high-level Rebel sympathizers&#x2014;and activate those spies, the Empire could very well crumble from within.&#x201d;<br><br>Vader regarded him stonily before he raised a gauntleted finger to point accusingly at the Inquisitor. &#x201c;What are you doing about it?&#x201d; he demanded.<br><br>&#x201c;Lord Vader, I have my best operative on the trail of this item even as we speak. I have trained this agent for many years, and I believe there is no one better suited for the mission. We will not fail,&#x201d; he promised, barely hiding the quaver in his voice.<br><br>Vader stared a moment longer and then turned to walk down the hallway, his heavy footfalls muffled by the thick pile of the carpets. The Inquisitor hastened his step to keep up.<br><br>&#x201c;The Death Star incident will never occur again,&#x201d; Vader told Redge. The Inquisitor knew the Sith Lord was not really sharing a confidence with him as much as he was simply thinking aloud. However, he did nothing to interrupt Vader, awed as he was in the moment.<br><br>&#x201c;The fact that those plans slipped through our fingers and reached the cursed Rebels . . .&#x201d; Vader&#x2019;s voice trailed away and he tightened the fingers of<br>his left hand.<br><br>As he did so, Redge felt a pressure build up around his heart. His breathing grew more rapid, and black spots began to dance around the corners of his vision. He slowed his pace and vaguely sawthat Vader was continuing on, unaware that he had lost his stricken companion. Redge placed a hand<br>against his chest. He felt as if a fambaa were settled atop it. His head swam. Then, as abruptly as the pressure began, it disappeared. He rested one hand against the marble wall and tried to catch his breath before trotting weakly after Vader, who had not paused in his march.<br><br>&#x201c;Inquisitor?&#x201d; Vader demanded.<br><br>&#x201c;Y-yes, my lord?&#x201d; Redge stammered, barely recovered from Vader&#x2019;s unconscious assault.<br><br>&#x201c;Your best agent, you say?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Lord Vader,&#x201d; Redge said, his voice growing stronger with every passing moment. &#x201c;This agent will not fail.&#x201d;<br><br>Darth Vader turned and stared at Redge once more. &#x201c;Inquisitor, you should know full well that that there is no such thing as failure within the Empire. I suggest you remember that.&#x201d; He raised a finger and shook it once, ominously, toward the Inquisitor and then turned and left. The hiss of his automated breathing faded as he marched down the length of the passageway. Only when Redge was no longer in the presence of the Sith Lord did he realize that he had been holding his own breath. He let it out slowly.<br><br>Redge turned from the hallway and walked over to an alcove with a view of the Emperor&#x2019;s personal sh...</p><h2>Bath Tangle (Regency Romances, 14)</h2><p><p><b>"Witty, humorous, a well-constructed plot."-Candace Camp, New York Times bestselling author of <i>Suddenly</i></b></p><p><b><i>A Delightful Tangle of Affairs...</i></b><br>The Earl of Spenborough had always been noted for his eccentricity.

He acknowledges that whoever introduces the theme of &#x201c;virtue&#x201d; and &#x201c;the virtues&#x201d; can expect to be met with a smile &#x2013; of various shades of condescension. He then proceeds to single out &#x201c;prudence&#x201d; as the fundamental virtue on which the other cardinal virtues are based. In defining it, he does away with the shallow connotations which have debased it in modern times. Similarly, he manages to divest it of all traces of &#x201c;moralism,&#x201d; which, to a large extent has become identified with the Christian idea of virtue and has made it fall into general disrepute.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Pieper, <i>prudence </i>is fundamentally based on a clear perception of reality &#x2013; of things as they are &#x2013; and the prudent person is the one who acts in accordance with this perception. It has nothing to do with knowing how to avoid decisions which might be to one&#x2019;s disadvantage. Similarly, <i>justice</i>, which is based on prudence, involves acting toward other persons according to one&#x2019;s perception of the truth of the circumstances &#x2013; again, a perception of things &#x201c;as they are.&#x201d; This is not a reference to any &#x201c;status quo,&#x201d; but to the reality as constituted by the Creator.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In referring to <i>courage </i>[fortitude], Pieper discusses the overcoming of fear. This does not imply <i>having </i>no fear but, precisely, <i>overcoming </i>it. With regard to the fundamental fear of death, Pieper rejects the approaches which contend that there is nothing to fear in death. On the contrary, there is everything to fear in death: it concerns the question of possible absolute annihilation!&nbsp; Here Pieper introduces the consideration of the &#x201c;theological&#x201d; virtues of faith, hope, and love [charity]. When confronted with the question of possible annihilation, the Christian&#x2019;s faith is paramount. Belief in God lets him confront danger and overcome even the most radical fear &#x2013; through hope in God.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His love of God does not wipe out fear but gives him courage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Moderation </i>is seen as the last in the hierarchy of the cardinal virtues. Through its manifestation, in recent Christian thinking, with chastity and abstinence, it became in the Christian mind the most prominent characteristic of the Christian idea of man and one that dominated everything else. It has been reduced to the status of the most private of the virtues and is combined with a moralistic conception of the good. Pieper&#x2019;s analysis of moderation shows how this virtue needs to be rethought, although, even then, it will remain the last in the hierarchy of virtues.<br>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>The late Josef Pieper was author of numerous works in philosophy and theology. St. Augustine's Press has published a number of these: <i>The Concept of Sin, The Silence of St. Thomas, The Silence of Goethe, Tradition, Death and Immortality, Enthusiasm and Divine Madness, Happiness and Contemplation, In Tune with the World, </i>and <i>Scholasticism</i>, as well as the forthcoming <i>Platonic Myths.</i></p></p><h2>Five Silent Years of Corrie ten Boom, The</h2><p>Pam Roswell Moore had her doubts when she interviewed to be companion of the much-loved author Corrie ten Boom. Corrie&#39;s best-selling book The Hiding Place, which recounted how she and her family had hidden Jews during World War II in Holland until their betrayal and arrest by the Nazis, had launched for Corrie a worldwide ministry of travel and speaking. Awed by the spiritual challenge this companionship posed, Pam wondered how she could keep up with the energetic 83-year-old. But God knit a strong bond between the young Englishwoman and the remarkable Dutch evangelist. Then Corrie suffered a stroke. Hospitalization followed; physical therapy; then long, loving hours at home. Corrie regained a little mobility for a time -- until the next strokes hit. She never regained her speech. But the ministry that had touched millions continued as Corrie communicated through her eyes, through elaborate guessing games with those around her, through silent intercession for people God brought to mind. For those five silent years of imprisonment, Corrie&#39;s spiritual depth offered mute testimony to her ongoing trust in her heavenly Father. The details of these years will move all who loved Corrie ten Boom. They will encourage those involved with the elderly or handicapped -- and those who are themselves bedridden -- that God is at work mysteriously in and through even the most incapacitated. This book attests to the truth Corrie loved so dearly: that, in spite of everything else, Jesus is always Victor.</p><p>Pamela Rosewell Moore, originally from England, is an experienced speaker and author. She worked seven years in the Netherlands with Brother Andrew, &#34;God&#39;s Smuggler,&#34; and was the assistant and traveling companion to Corrie ten Boom from 1976 - 1983. More recently, she was the director of intercessory prayer at Dallas Baptist University. She and her husband, Carey, live in the Dallas, Texas area.</p><h2>West of Eden: An American Place</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER �&nbsp;An epic, mesmerizing oral history of Hollywood and Los Angeles from the author of the contemporary classic&nbsp;<i>Edie</i></b><br><br>Jean Stein transformed the art of oral history in her groundbreaking book <i>Edie: American Girl,</i> an indelible portrait of Andy Warhol &#x201c;superstar&#x201d; Edie Sedgwick, which was edited with George Plimpton. Now, in <i>West of Eden,</i> she turns to Los Angeles, the city of her childhood. Stein vividly captures a mythic cast of characters: their ambitions and triumphs as well as their desolation and grief.<br><br> These stories illuminate the bold aspirations of five larger-than-life individuals and their families. <i>West of Eden</i> is a work of history both grand in scale and intimate in detail. At the center of each family is a dreamer who finds fortune and strife in Southern California: Edward Doheny, the Wisconsin-born oil tycoon whose corruption destroyed the reputation of a U.S. president and led to his own son&#x2019;s violent death; Jack Warner, the son of Polish-Jewish immigrants, who together with his brothers founded one of the world&#x2019;s most iconic film studios; Jane Garland, the troubled daughter of an aspiring actress who could never escape her mother&#x2019;s schemes; Jennifer Jones, an actress from Oklahoma who won the Academy Award at twenty-five but struggled with despair amid her fame and glamour. Finally, Stein chronicles the ascent of her own father, Jules Stein, an eye doctor born in Indiana who transformed Hollywood with the creation of an unrivaled agency and studio.<br><br> In each chapter, Stein paints a portrait of an outsider who pins his or her hopes on the nascent power and promise of Los Angeles. Each individual&#x2019;s unyielding intensity pushes loved ones, especially children, toward a perilous threshold. <i>West of Eden</i> depicts the city that has projected its own image of America onto the world, in all its idealism and paradox.

Beyond the fence the hill sloped for several miles. On this lower level faint and far off I could just barely see some of the old wooden derricks of the oilfield from which the Sternwoods had made their money. . . . A little of it was still producing in groups of wells pumping five or six barrels a day. The Sternwoods, having moved up the hill, could no longer smell the stale sump water or the oil, but they could still look out of their front windows and see what had made them rich.

And the story of Edward L. Doheny is centered around a Pandora&#x2019;s box that unleashed an extraordinary sequence of events, enthralling the nation for a decade. It involved the fall and death of a president. It involved millions and millions of dollars paid to some of the most gifted lawyers in the country. It involved two slayings intimately connected to Doheny in circumstances that are still very murky. And it ended in the fall from grace for Doheny&#x2014;at one point the richest man in America&#x2014;who died in 1935 broken and disgraced, very much by his own actions and his determination to protect himself<br><br>Patrick &#x201c;Ned&#x201d; Doheny: My great-grandfather was shocked at the way that everything spun out. When you think about a guy that strong being broken, you have to wonder what it must have been like to have had to deal with all those elements, who you had to be in order to survive it. It was a tragedy, but the history books have always done a hatchet job on him. It&#x2019;s the heartlessness that I find the most bitter about the interpretation of our family. And it upsets me that someone like my great-grandfather, who was such a seminal figure, gets supplanted by a cardboard stick figure. That&#x2019;s madness.<br><br>What my great-grandfather did is almost beyond conception in terms of the amount of money that he made, the success that he enjoyed, and the wildness of his adventure. That whole business with There Will Be Blood, however, was completely apocryphal. There&#x2019;s not a shred of truth in it. The only true part of the film was at the beginning, with him in the mine shaft by himself: he did always say he once fell down a mine shaft and broke his legs. But all the rest of it is utter horseshit. All these people&#x2014;Upton Sinclair with Oil! and later the movie people&#x2014;had a vested interest in furthering their own agendas, and it&#x2019;s ludicrous to confuse those agendas with history. I enjoyed the movie, and I thought Daniel Day-Lewis was outrageously good. But it had nothing to do with my people at all. The actual story itself is so much more interesting than anything they might have come up with.<br><br>Shuffle the cards, and deal a new round of poker hands: they differ in every way from the previous round, and yet it is the same pack of cards, and the same game, with the same spirit, the players grim-faced and silent, surrounded by a haze of tobacco-smoke.<br><br>&#x2014;Upton Sinclair, Oil!<br><br>Richard Rayner: The Doheny saga is central to L.A. history in all sorts of ways. One thinks of Mulholland as being the twisted godfather who summoned L.A. into existence because he brought the water that allowed it to grow. But Doheny symbolizes the other way wealth was acquired in the first thirty years when L.A. was really growing. Between 1900 and 1930, the population went from something like one hundred thousand to one million and a quarter.<br><br>Mike Davis: The recent history of Los Angeles had been an exhilarating then terrifying roller-coaster ride. In late 1885 the arrival of the Santa Fe railroad in Southern California broke the decade-long monopoly of the Southern Pacific. By March the most extraordinary rate war in American history began with fares from Chicago dropping to an absurd one dollar then stabilizing at ten dollars. Two hundred thousand curious visitors took advantage of the cheap fares to come visit the Land of Sunshine and dip their toes into the Pacific. First, however, they had to run a gauntlet of realtors and their sandwich-board boys waiting outside the stations to sell them a dream lot in one of the new garden suburbs or in the barren hills around the city. Los Angeles was laying ultramodern concrete sidewalks, but its main streets remained dirt and gravel and too often mud. But an old prospector like Doheny was probably happier with bare rock and exposed ground. He also may have enjoyed the ineradicable wildness everywhere on the city&#x2019;s edges. Los Angeles had little water, no coal, no improved harbor, no manufacturing, a still largely undeveloped hinterland, and a permanent shortage of capital. But these comprehensive disadvantages were the secret of the locals; the newcomers, having seen Eden, were easily convinced to buy a piece of it.<br><br>Richard Rayner: The population was driven by oil, and Doheny was the guy who created the L.A. oil industry, even though he made the vast part of his fortune in Mexico. In the 1920s L.A. produced 20 percent of the world&#x2019;s oil. When you look at pictures of the great forests of oil derricks studded all over the city or read Upton Sinclair&#x2019;s Oil!, you see it. It&#x2019;s absolutely staggering, and Doheny was responsible for that. But there are all these years of his life before that period about which not much is known, when he was roaming around the West in the 1870s and 1880s. We don&#x2019;t really start to get to know him until he&#x2019;s in his forties. I suspect he was quite desperate by then, because everything had failed. But we do know the story of his first wife, whom he left alone&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s quite dark.<br><br>MaryAnn Bonino: Edward Doheny married his first wife, Carrie Wilkins, in Kingston, New Mexico, in 1883. She never knew her father, a Civil War surgeon who went off to war when she was an infant and didn&#x2019;t come back. She and her mother lived the life of pioneers&#x2014;and it was a very hard life, in particular for women on their own. In spite of all of that, Carrie seems to have been a woman of considerable sensitivity. She was active in the Episcopal church and also an engaging amateur singer, taking a &#x201c;large audience by storm&#x201d; when she and Edward lived in Kingston, and also later in Silver City. After they moved to Los Angeles in 1891, their emotional and financial lives were marked with highs and lows. Their son, Ned, was born in 1893, but their seven-year-old daughter, Eileen, died one year earlier of a rheumatic heart condition. Edward discovered oil in Los Angeles and Orange County, but as he took on new business risks things became financially rocky&#x2014;which might explain why between 1895 and 1899 they changed their residence every single year. In late April 1899, Carrie decided to take some time away, going to San Francisco and taking Ned with her. It may be that she went north because Edward himself was moving to Kern County, where he had just found oil. But since Carrie never came back, she may have left for another reason. It was during this time that Estelle Betzold, who would later become Edward&#x2019;s second wife, was working as a telephone operator&#x2014;most likely in the same building as his office. The story goes that Edward heard Estelle&#x2019;s voice and was charmed by it. She did have a charming voice&#x2014;everyone said that&#x2014;and a playful and sassy style. It may be that Carrie&#x2019;s departure coincided with an initial flirtation between Estelle and Edward.<br><br>Carrie didn&#x2019;t divorce Edward until eleven months after she left him. Even then, and after moving to Oakland, she must have retained some feelings for him. In late September 1900&#x2014;about a month after Edward married Estelle, and three weeks after he brought his new bride to San Francisco (and probably across the bay to Oakland)&#x2014;Carrie killed herself. The published biographies of Doheny suggest strongly that Carrie was in some way disturbed, but the facts suggest otherwise.<br><br>Carole Wells Doheny: Carrie got so despondent over him getting married that she killed herself. The family later got depression from her. It&#x2019;s a very cruel thing that happens to people. But nobody really talks about her.<br><br>MaryAnn Bonino: She drank battery fluid. According to the women who worked for her, she confused it for a cold medication she had ordered from the pharmacy. She may have staged it to look like a mistake. Ned was probably there. She took the poison during the morning when he was very likely at school, but he would certainly have been around for the aftermath and heard the reports of her &#x201c;violent screaming,&#x201d; which went on for some hours. And on top of all that, Ned remained in that same house for almost ten months after her death. Perhaps Edward and Estelle thought it would be better to leave Ned in Oakland with familiar staff and a routine he was accustomed to. They themselves were overwhelmed by events. In addition to the shock of Carrie&#x2019;s suicide, their own marriage of barely a month was completely unplanned, they had no home of their own, and Edward faced an enormous amount of work resulting from his otherwise incredible piece of luck&#x2014;his discovery of oil in Mexico. But that plan clearly didn&#x2019;t work because Ned was acting up and kicking his governess black and blue. By the end of July 1901, Estelle was in Oakland taking care of him herself, and two weeks later she wrote to Edward, &#x201c;You and I would&#x2019;ve been condemned for murder if we hadn&#x2019;t come to the rescue by this time.&#x201d;<br><br>Richard Rayner: The story of Doheny&#x2019;s involvement in Mexico is utterly amazing. It&#x2019;s both this wonderful entrepreneurial swashbuckling adventure and an absolutely naked act of imperial manipulation and theft. Doheny serially bribed his way upwards through the Mexican government until he became friendly with President Porfirio D�az, from whom he secured exclusive rights to drill for oil in an area near the town of Tampico that held the richest oil deposits in the world at that time. And after the fall of his buddy D�az in the Mexican Revolution, he managed to maneuver through the various political changes and insurgencies that followed and maintain his holdings.<br><br>Patrick &#x201c;Ned&#x201d; Doheny: Regarding the whole business with the oil lands in Mexico, my god, there were whole countries angling for that. The British were in there, and the Germans were in there, too. That&#x2019;s where we get ranchero music, which is basically &#x201c;oompa&#x201d; music from Germany. That&#x2019;s why Mexican beer is so good, too. Everybody was trying to back whatever petty tyrant they could, to ensure that they could get their hands on whatever natural resources were there.<br><br>Richard Rayner: From 1903 to 1918, Doheny took sixty-five trips to Mexico, suborning and turning a huge area covering 450,000 acres of the countryside into a personal fiefdom with a clear-cut apartheid system. It was a microcosm and an exaggeration of what America tried to pretend that it wasn&#x2019;t at the time. Not surprisingly, he was resented and hated by a lot of people in Mexico. Reports at that time from the Bureau of Investigation, the precursor to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, note various Mexican revolutionaries hanging around outside Doheny&#x2019;s mansion in L.A. on Chester Place. At least one historian, Dan La Botz, even thinks that Doheny might later have been behind the assassination of Venustiano Carranza, Mexico&#x2019;s constitutional president who had wanted to nationalize the oil industry. True or not, early on Doheny clearly saw that the leftist movement in Mexico could threaten him, so he eventually built a private army to protect his massive holdings, especially when Mexico was in the throes of a revolution. But his real aim was to get the U.S. Marines to occupy Mexico so that he wouldn&#x2019;t have to protect everything himself. Through it all, Doheny managed to hold on through various means. And he caused a lot of anger down there.<br><br>John Creel: Edward Doheny realized how useful my great-uncle, Enrique Creel, could be for his agenda, since Enrique was a very prominent statesman and banker in Mexico with strong connections to President D�az. When Enrique was the Mexican ambassador to the United States, Doheny gave a banquet in his honor at the exclusive Alexandria Hotel in Los Angeles. The event, called &#x201c;one of the most notable ever given in California,&#x201d; by the Los Angeles Examiner, featured Caviar Imperiale D&#x2019;Astrakhan as a starter. Doheny even arranged for special fountains on the elliptical dinner table that spouted streams of red, white, and green, with the voice of Caruso serenading the guests from underneath the table. The event cost easily $150 a plate&#x2014;in 1907 dollars&#x2014;and was referred to as &#x201c;a riot of extravagance&#x201d; by the Examiner&#x2019;s rival, the Los Angeles Times. I would have loved to have been there. They knew how to entertain, didn&#x2019;t they?<br><br>Richard Rayner: Perhaps not coincidentally, a week before Doheny threw the banquet for Enrique Creel, private detectives in L.A. under orders from Creel brutally arrested the fugitive Mexican intellectual Ricardo Flores Mag�n, a leading anarchist who advocated for land reform in Mexico. Doheny managed to hold on to his bit of Mexico through an extraordinary dance of daring and corruption. It&#x2019;s Doheny at his boldest.<br><br>Patrick &#x201c;Ned&#x201d; Doheny: Estelle was holding on for dear life then, with these periods of incredible loneliness when she never saw this person she&#x2019;d married&#x2014;and then boom, he would come back from Mexico. He was probably the richest man in the United States. Can you imagine what it would have been like to have found yourself in that situation, in that time? For god&#x2019;s sakes, you go from being a telephone operator to having Steinway make you a piano with a bust of your child on either side of the keyboard? You can go look in the Steinway catalog. They made a piano with Ned&#x2019;s head carved into it. This is not reality&#x2014;this is an altered state.<br><br>Carole Wells Doheny: Edward and Estelle were in San Francisco at the World&#x2019;s Fair, and she saw this wonderful display from Pompeii with pink-and-black marble pillars. Eighteen of these pillars were in an oblong circle, and she said, &#x201c;I would love to have that as a ballroom.&#x201d; So he had it all dismantled and taken to Chester Place, where they made it into the ballroom. Wouldn&#x2019;t you love to be able to say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to have that,&#x201d; and it was done?<br><br>Richard Rayner: Doheny&#x2019;s house doesn&#x2019;t look like the kind of place you could imagine living in, but what they were aspiring to was really some sort of Gilded Age fantasy.</p><h2>The Month of St. Joseph</h2><p>St. Teresa of Avila tells us, <i>"I took for my advocate and lord the glorious Saint Joseph and commended myself earnestly to him...he gave me greater blessings than I could ask of him. I do not remember even now that I have ever asked anything of him which he has failed to grant."</i><br><br> This hidden saint, the blessed foster-father of our Lord and protector of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is a powerful intercessor for us, as well as a model of perfect virtue. The bible records not a single word of his, yet we know that in the holy house at Nazareth, the young Jesus-the Word made Flesh-was subject to him. Through this series of daily meditations for the month of March, we may increase our devotion to this great saint while also making a fruitful use of the days of Lent. <br><br> As patron not only of fathers and of the worker, but of the universal church, all of us-men and women, old and young-would do well to look to him in our every need.</p><p></p><h2>From Gospels to Glory: Exploring the New Testament</h2><p>Maps are essential to an explorer.

Hartley, PhD, CRC</strong> is an assistant professor and coordinator of the rehabilitation and mental health specialization in the Counseling Program, Department of Disability and Psychoeducational Studies at the University of Arizona. His scholarly interests lie in the professionalization of rehabilitation counseling, including the application of ethical principles. Much of his work has targeted distributive justice issues and therefore his scholarship on ethical obligations has focused on the importance of promoting resilience and of advocating against ableism or the preference for able-bodiedness. Dr. Hartley has collaborated on research grants and was the primary investigator on recent grant-funded research projects focused on developing innovative interventions to support resilience among military veterans with spinal cord injuries. He has also worked to support youth with disabilities during the school-to-work transition to increase resilience and decrease dropout. In the area of advocacy, he has been involved in leadership and research collaborations with Centers of Independent Living (CILs) to teach and empower individuals with disabilities to advocate for themselves. Rooted in the concept of self-advocacy, his research on advocacy has emphasized the use of digital technology as a way for individuals who have experienced marginalization to reclaim power and control over their environments. Finally, his research on salient ethical issues in contemporary rehabilitation counseling practice were used to guide recent revisions to the 2016 Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor (CRCC) Code of Ethics, a taskforce he served on. Dr. Hartley is knowledgeable about the profession and professional practice of rehabilitation counseling, and is committed to defining and better preparing rehabilitation counselors to work ethically and effectively with persons with disabilities.</p></p><h2>Treating Bipolar Disorder: A Clinician&#39;s Guide to Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (Guides to Individualized Evidence-Based Treatment)</h2><p>This innovative manual presents a powerful approach for helping people manage bipolar illness and protect against the recurrence of manic or depressive episodes. Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy focuses on stabilizing moods by improving medication adherence, building coping skills and relationship satisfaction, and shoring up the regularity of daily rhythms or routines. Each phase of this flexible, evidence-based treatment is vividly detailed, from screening, assessment, and case conceptualization through acute therapy, maintenance treatment, and periodic booster sessions. Among the special features are reproducible assessment tools and a chapter on how to overcome specific treatment challenges.</p><p>Ellen Frank, PhD, is Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. She received her doctorate in psychology from the University of Pittsburgh in 1979. Dr. Frank's work focuses on the treatment of mood disorders, with particular emphasis on the prevention of recurrence. She is the author of over 350 journal articles, books, and book chapters.<br>"Ellen Frank's manual is an important contribution to the treatment of bipolar disorder. It clearly articulates the nature of the illness, how best to conceptualize the role of psychotherapy in a condition whose origins and treatments are primarily biological, how to assess the goals of therapy for an individual patient, and the specifics of utilizing IPSRT. This book is a welcome addition to the field."--Kay Redfield Jamison, PhD, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine<br><br>"In easy-to-read prose, Ellen Frank explains interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, a new psychosocial intervention for bipolar disorder. Based on her groundbreaking work on the role of sleep-wake cycle disturbances in the onset of mania, Dr. Frank explains how stabilizing people's daily routines can enhance mood stability and interpersonal functioning. She provides step-by-step methods for addressing interpersonal problems associated with the illness, such that clinicians will be well on their way to using the treatment even with their most severely ill patients. The case studies are highly illustrative of the complexities of treating this debilitating illness. There is much wisdom in this book for clinicians and researchers."--David J. Miklowitz, PhD, Department of Psychology, University of Colorado, Boulder<br><br>"Using a creative combination of techniques, Dr. Frank provides a structure that will allow clinicians to intervene more helpfully with patients with bipolar disorder. A well-written and scientific description of the illness forms the basis for the provision of clear strategies for coping with it more effectively. Rich case examples demonstrate an empathic understanding of the illness and its devastating impact on patients and families. Clinicians working with this population should find this readable, pragmatic book an essential addition to their professional libraries."--Carol M.

They&#x2019;d rather snack on tractors or a rocket ship or two, or tender trailer tidbits, or a wheely, steely stew. But boy do those trees they&#x2019;re munching on look an awful lot like broccoli.

She lives in Brighton, England.PreSchool-K&#x2014;Grown-ups know that kids generally don't like eating broccoli. Apparently, neither do monsters. Sure, they like tractors, rocket ships, and boulders. Only don't give them artichokes, lima beans, or anything green. When the "monsters" eat giant maple trees, though, they discover they have been fooled into eating the dreaded broccoli. The next spread reveals that the monsters are children who have fallen for that age-old adult trick of calling broccoli "trees." Not only that, but they also discover that "trees" are so delicious, they beg for "Another helping, please." For the most part, the rhyming text flows nicely when read aloud but it stumbles when the monsters repeatedly shout, "Fum,/foe,/fie,/fee,/monsters don't eat broccoli." The gouache illustrations are bright and textured; they pop off the page. However, the monsters and the backgrounds are done in similar hues so that the creatures sometimes blend into the scenery. Among a crowded field, this title doesn't stand out.

The bright white light from emergency spotlights cast an eerie starkness throughout the burned building. Her boots sloshing through the water left behind by the firefighters. Tens of thousands of gallons had flowed into this building to put out the blaze, and the fire crew was surveying the structure to insure there were no remaining hot spots.<br><br>They&#x2019;d been damn lucky. Last winter had been dry, creating a summer combustible with dry brush and trees. The hill of dead, brown foliage behind Butcher-Payne, and the arid canyon across the two-lane highway, could easily have caught fire, spreading through the crisp timber and underbrush faster than they could respond. Fortunately, there&#x2019;d been no wind to push the fire, and the first responders had done a magnificent job saturating the rooftops and surrounding grounds. In addition, the solid exterior and internal firewalls of the five-year-old building had contained the fire within the research wing.<br><br>&#x201c;The fire sprinklers didn&#x2019;t go on as they were supposed to,&#x201d; the Placer County fire chief, Ansel Nobel, said while he escorted Nora to where the body had been found. &#x201c;The most recent inspection was three months ago; then, they were functioning properly. I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have you checked the water-pump station? Is this area on city or well water?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a water storage tank uphill for&#x2014;damn, that&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The water storage tank is for the hydrants. The sprinklers are on a pump system maintained by the county. We hooked up the hydrants without any problems, so when my crew chief told me the sprinklers hadn&#x2019;t come on, I assumed they were faulty.&#x201d;<br><br>He gestured at the ceiling with his flashlight. The sprinkler heads had distended, but had no water.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll ask my partner to check it out.&#x201d; She called Pete Antonovich using the walkie-talkie feature of her BlackBerry. Technically he was no longer her partner, now that she&#x2019;d been temporarily promoted to squad leader while their SSA was teaching for four months at Quantico. But old habits; she and Pete had been partners since she transferred to Sacramento FBI headquarters nine years ago.<br><br>&#x201c;Pete, it&#x2019;s Nora. Chief Nobel said the sprinklers didn&#x2019;t activate. The pump may have been sabotaged&#x2014;can you talk to the sheriff&#x2019;s department and get a team over there to check it out?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Will do. What&#x2019;s it like inside?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wet.&#x201d;<br><br>His voice had a modicum of restrained humor. &#x201c;I meant damages.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Same apparent burn pattern as the previous arson fires. Started in the lab and was contained ninety percent there and adjoining offices. The lobby walls have some damage. Hot enough to melt electronic equipment. Arson investigation will know more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When&#x2019;s Quin going to get here?&#x201d;<br><br>Nora hesitated a moment. Her sister had a reputation, and she hated to fuel it. But this was Pete, so she simply said, &#x201c;She had a date.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s five-thirty in the morning.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In San Francisco. She promised she&#x2019;d leave immediately. She wasn&#x2019;t on call tonight,&#x201d; Nora defended.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not being critical, but we need her. I don&#x2019;t need to tell you they&#x2019;re escalating.&#x201d;<br><br>The arson gang they&#x2019;d been investigating for twenty months had never killed before. The three previous arsons had targeted the same industry&#x2014;biotechnology&#x2014;but the first two were set in warehouses, and the third fire in a small genetic research building at Sacramento State University. Nora wasn&#x2019;t certain yet exactly what Butcher-Payne did, but they had &#x201c;Biotech&#x201d; in their name and that, coupled with the &#x201c;message&#x201d; that had been spray-painted on the exterior&#x2014;stop murder, signed with the moniker the previous arsonists used, BLF&#x2014;was enough to make Nora and Pete feel comfortable adding Butcher-Payne to the list.<br><br>The only difference in the arson at Butcher-Payne was the victim. Why kill now? Accident or premeditated? Was Jonah Payne targeted because he was Jonah Payne, or simply because he headed the research lab?<br><br>&#x201c;Something else is going on. This just doesn&#x2019;t feel right to me.&#x201d; Nora caught herself twisting her shortish, dark blond hair between her thumb and forefinger. She tucked the loose curls behind her ear and dropped her hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you seen the vic?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m heading that way now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I did a field test on the graffiti. The paint is identical to the other arson fires. Chances that this is a copycat drop dramatically.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dammit, Pete, they haven&#x2019;t killed anyone before.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was just a matter of time, you know that. I&#x2019;ll go check the pumps and get back to you.&#x201d;<br><br>Nora pocketed her BlackBerry as Chief Nobel said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s happened before.&#x201d;<br><br>That seemed obvious to Nora, and should to Chief Nobel, who was well aware of the previous three arsons. &#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Arsonists setting a fire not knowing someone is inside.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It still makes them murderers, whether they intended to kill someone or not.&#x201d;<br><br>Nobel stood at the entrance to Jonah Payne&#x2019;s office. &#x201c;Brace yourself, it&#x2019;s not pretty.&#x201d;<br><br>Nora buried her emotions deep. It didn&#x2019;t matter how many times she saw a dead body, or in what condition, the anger and deep sadness at a life taken too soon could overwhelm her if she didn&#x2019;t close off her feelings. She couldn&#x2019;t afford to impair her critical judgment. Cops learned to compartmentalize to do the job or they ended up dead or drunk. There was a reason cops had nearly twice the suicide rate as the population at large.<br><br>Her ability to fully detach herself had earned her a reputation as levelheaded with those who liked her, and a cold bitch with those who didn&#x2019;t.<br><br>Chief Nobel stepped aside. Bright crime-scene tape crisscrossed the charred opening leading into Dr. Jonah Payne&#x2019;s office off the main research laboratory. The metal door was open, the paint burned off on one side. Had it been open or closed when the fire crew came in? The office itself wasn&#x2019;t large, approximately fourteen feet square. Paper fueled the flames in here, soggy remnants of pulp everywhere, higher piles of wet ash and partially burned paper on the credenza behind the large desk. No windows, no natural light&#x2014;Nora didn&#x2019;t know how anyone could work in such conditions. She&#x2019;d put skylights in every room of her small country home because she needed sunlight.<br><br>The only thing her mother had ever done for her was give her an appreciation of nature.<br><br>Good job keeping your emotions in check, thinking of that woman.<br><br>Nora focused on the victim, presumed to be Jonah Payne, who lay flat on his back in front of his desk. His position seemed odd to Nora. She&#x2019;d investigated only one domestic terrorism case that had resulted in fire deaths: in that case, the fourteen victims had been trapped in a burning building and all had died of smoke inhalation. The bodies had been either in fetal positions or prone.<br><br>Payne had second- and third-degree burns over all exposed areas of his body. His hair was gone, and the metal from his glasses had melted into his charred skin. His shirt was completely gone, but he&#x2019;d been wearing jeans, she noted, and while they were black they appeared intact. Denim could withstand fire longer than many other natural-fiber materials. They&#x2019;d need to put together all these details to figure out exactly what happened to Payne and whether his death was intentional or accidental.<br><br>Fire fatalities were among the most difficult crimes to investigate. Much of the damage to the body came from necessary fire-suppression activities, but when firefighters discovered a victim, they did everything they could to preserve evidence while also putting out the flames. Unless there was a bullet in the body, severe blunt-force trauma, or another obvious external force, determining cause of death was extremely difficult.<br><br>The man inspecting the body glanced up. &#x201c;Chief.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Keith, this is Special Agent Nora English with the FBI&#x2019;s domestic terrorism unit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t come in,&#x201d; he ordered.<br><br>&#x201c;Nora, have you met our M.E., Keith Coffey?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Dr. Coffey, does it seem odd to you that the victim is on his back?&#x201d;<br><br>He stopped his inspection and looked at her. &#x201c;Yes, it is very odd. But I don&#x2019;t want to jump to conclusions before the fire inspector gets here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s on her way,&#x201d; Nora said. &#x201c;She was out of town and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>A raspy voice behind her bellowed, &#x201c;She? Last I checked I&#x2019;m still a man, sugar.&#x201d;<br><br>Nora bristled and turned. The smoker&#x2019;s voice belonged to a man who looked old enough to be her grandfather. He wore black pants and a red plaid shirt on which was clipped a fire marshal&#x2019;s badge.<br><br>The man grinned at her and winked. &#x201c;Yep, still a man.&#x201d;</p><h2>Dark Mirror: Edward Snowden and the American Surveillance State</h2><p><b>From the three-time Pulitzer Prize-winner and author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Angler</i>, the definitive master narrative of the modern surveillance state, based on unique access to Edward Snowden and groundbreaking reportage around the world.</b><br><br>Edward Snowden chose three journalists to tell the stories in his Top Secret trove of NSA documents: Barton Gellman of&nbsp;<i>The Washington Post</i>, Glenn Greenwald of&nbsp;<i>The Guardian&nbsp;</i>and filmmaker Laura Poitras, all of whom would share the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. Poitras went on to direct the Oscar-winning&nbsp;<i>Citizenfour</i>. Greenwald cast himself as a pugilist on Snowden's behalf.&nbsp;<br><br> Gellman, whose relationship with his source was more turbulent, took his own path. Snowden and his documents were the beginning, not the end, of a story he had prepared his whole life to tell. More than two decades as a top investigative journalist armed him with deep sources in national security and high technology. Gellman's reporting continued to unlock new puzzles long after the headlines began to fade. Fresh discoveries in this book touch us all.<br><br> <i>Dark Mirror</i>&nbsp;is a true-life spy tale, told with authority and an inside view of extraordinary events. Within it is a compelling portrait of investigative journalism under pressure of legal threats, government investigations and foreign intelligence agencies intent on stealing Gellman&#x2019;s files. The NSA director secretly calls for a federal raid to seize the leaked documents. The author finds his name in one of those documents&#x2014;as the target of a previous leak investigation. Google warns him that &#x201c;state sponsored attackers&#x201d; are trying to compromise his account. His tablet is hacked before his eyes as he leaves the set of a Sunday news broadcast. Customized malware is sent to his computer. Sophisticated impostors approach him with counterfeit documents, attempting to divert or discredit his work. Throughout&nbsp;<i>Dark Mirror</i>, Gellman wages an escalating battle against unknown adversaries who force him to mimic their tradecraft in self-defense.&nbsp;<br><br> With the vivid and insightful style that marked Gellman's bestselling&nbsp;<i>Angler</i>,<i>&nbsp;Dark Mirror</i>&nbsp;is an inside account of the surveillance-industrial revolution and its discontents.

Ressentiment and Other Value Shifts in Modern Morality.. . . . . . . . . This monograph constitutes a response to the criticisms of Christianity outlined in Nietzsche&#39;s GENEOLOGY OF MORALS, in which Nietzsche argues that Christianity is a &#39;slave revolt&#39; of the weak--an attempt by the impotent to bring down the vitality of the capable nobility. Scheler&#39;s response is multi-faceted but centers on Nietzsche&#39;s failure to understand the nature of Christian love. Christianity is not a destructive enterprise trying to bring everyone down to the same low level of its impotent faithful, who must put their trust in the next world because they can get nowhere in this one. Rather, it attempts constructively to bring everyone up to a new level of human flourishing. Christianity&#39;s preoccupation with the poor, weak, and marginalized stems from a recognition, through divine love, of the miracle of God&#39;s creation and infinite possibilities present even in them.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Classical Christian Doctrine: Introducing the Essentials of the Ancient Faith</h2><p>This clear and concise text helps readers grasp the doctrines of the Christian faith considered basic from the earliest days of Christianity. Ronald Heine, an internationally known expert on early Christian theology, developed this book from a course he teaches that has been refined through many years of classroom experience. Heine primarily uses the classical Christian doctrines of the Nicene Creed to guide students into the essentials of the faith.<br><br>This broadly ecumenical work will interest students of church history or theology as well as adult Christian education classes in church settings. Sidebars identify major personalities and concepts, and each chapter concludes with discussion questions and suggestions for further reading.</p><p>"Here at last is an introductory theology text that gracefully inducts beginning students into Christian doctrines deriving from the Nicene Creed. Undergraduates as well as seminarians will meet the major minds and texts that shaped classical Christian theology and emerge equipped to engage the intricacies of Christianity's doctrinal struggles through this most lucid portal, which is replete with textual excerpts, explanatory glosses, and accessible though not overly simplified presentations of hotly debated questions."<br>--<b>Ellen Charry</b>, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"If you are searching for a solid and solidifying introduction to the doctrines of early Christianity, this is it. Ronald Heine helps those of us who feel unsettled within our transitory age to find some steadiness of faith within the classical and foundational. This is a book for those who think beginnings might be important to beliefs, who think antiquity might enrich the contemporary, and who, because they don't like to free-fall, appreciate the groundwork."<br>--<b>D. Jeffrey Bingham</b>, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>"One couldn't ask for a clearer or more succinct account of the process whereby classical Christian doctrines were articulated. Shaped by the clauses of the Nicene Creed, it brilliantly sketches out how the early church fathers debated and appropriated scriptural themes. This sharp focus and the judicious selection of key elements in what can seem a dauntingly complex story make this an excellent initial text."<br>--<b>Frances Young</b>, University of Birmingham; author of <i>From Nicaea to Chalcedon<br></i><br>"Heine draws from the obvious breadth and depth of his many years of research to create a manual for beginning theologians. Here is a crisp and accessible text eminently suitable to introduce undergraduate students to the essentials of early Christian thought and the enduring truths of Christian doctrine."<br>--<b>Hans Boersma</b>, Nashotah House<br><br>"Heine has provided a fresh and invaluable introduction to the complex body of early Christian doctrine for an audience of nonspecialists. With his careful organization of the issues and proposed discussion questions, a broad array of themes, including Trinity, Christology, salvation, and eschatological hope, all come into sharp focus and are made accessible for Christians anxious to enrich and deepen their understanding of the church's faith and their own identity in relation to Christians past."<br>--<b>Paul Blowers</b>, Emmanuel Christian Seminary<b>Ronald E.

Sexual impurity creates a vicious circle, one that springs from misconceptions about Christ and further taints our understanding of Him. Yet another circle is available to men and women trapped in sexual sin, a circle of sexual redemption.<br><br>When practiced as God intends, spirituality and sexuality both draw us closer to Christ. Spiritual maturity and sexual maturity go hand-in-hand, and together they hold out the promise of redemption and restoration needed by everyone who has been damaged by sexual sin.<br><br>There is hope. Real change is possible; true intimacy is available. To the person who has failed time and time again sexually, God&#x2019;s message is simple: You, too, can be undefiled.</p><p><b>HARRY W. SCHAUMBURG</b>, MA, MS, DMin, LMFT, speaker, author and counselor, is the founder and Executive Director of Stone Gate Resources, Inc., a ministry that has addressed the problems of sexual sin within the church for more than eighteen years. Offering real change, his pioneering Brief Intensive CounselingSM program has drawn over two thousand five hundred laity and clergy from the U.S. and eighteen foreign countries. For nearly thirty years, Dr. Schaumburg has been involved in pointing people away from sexual sin to restored intimacy with God and others. He is the author of <i>False Intimacy: Understanding the Struggle of Sexual Addiction</i>, the first book on the subject from a biblical perspective, and <i>Sexual Redemption</i>. Married forty years to his wife Rosemary, they have two adult sons.<p><b><i>FOR INSIDE THE BOOK&nbsp;(Bold parts can be excerpted for the back cover if there is room)</i></b><br><br>---<br><br>The often quoted saying, &#x201c;When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.&#x201d; holds true in this recent work of Dr. Harry Schaumburg. The Church of Jesus Christ is thoroughly enmeshed in one moral crisis after the other, and we have been in desperate need for a truly biblical answer to this crisis. Several thousand years ago, someone said, &#x201c;...Increased years should teach wisdom.&#x201d; It is evident that Dr. Schaumburg&#x2019;s years of experience and his commitment to a thoroughly biblical approach to dealing with this issue has produced a work that shines with penetrating light into the one of the darkest areas of 21st century Christian life. I commend this work as a handbook for study in every church, as a resource to every pastor who has or will face this matter in their ministry and as a diagnostic tool for personal evaluation of one&#x2019;s own life and walk. <b>No pastor&#x2019;s library should be without this wonderful tool.

Garlington, Sr.<br>Senior Pastor<br>Covenant Church of Pittsburgh<br>Presiding Bishop <br>Reconciliation Ministries International<br><br>---<br><br>As the Church awakens to the mushrooming challenges of sexual sin and temptation, this book is important.&nbsp; Not only does Dr.<br>Schaumburg capture hearts through compelling narrative, he addresses the real issues head on. The author integrates a much needed Biblical<br>view of sex into the fabric of everyday faith.&nbsp; But most importantly, Dr. Schaumburg emphasizes the concept of sin, rather than the more<br>typical categorization of sexual sin as disease.&nbsp; Because sin is thoroughly addressed here with the gospel of Jesus Christ, hope and<br>power are present.&nbsp; <b>Undefiled is substantial, but written in a way that people can comprehend.&nbsp; It is my prayer that this work will be<br>widely read - leading to understanding, repentance and faith, and God's blessing for people and families.</b><br><br>Joseph Wheat<br>Pastor, PCA<br></p><p><i>---<br><br>From a former client: <br></i>Before going to see Dr. Schaumburg, I was terrified. Not only had my world as I thought I knew it crumbled, but I was desperate for some answers to why my spouse had done these things: didn&#x2019;t he care about our marriage? Our family? What was so wrong with me that he had to go elsewhere? While reeling from the revelations, I faced the thought of what to do next: should we spend more money we didn&#x2019;t have on counseling that although it was &#x201c;christian&#x201d; hadn&#x2019;t helped in the past?</p><p>Now, as an alumni of Dr. Schaumberg&#x2019;s method, I can tell you that this book offers a real answer for the above questions facing so many broken marriages today.&nbsp; The real solution is not about the counseling, the recovery programs, and finding who to blame for one&#x2019;s behavior--we tried those and they didn&#x2019;t bring true change. Dr. Schaumberg&#x2019;s method gets to the heart of the matter, literally. He guides each person to examine their own heart and see how it lines up with God&#x2019;s will for their life, step by step, just as if you were going through his program. <b>You will not be the same person you were if you read and follow the instructions in this book; in it you will find the keys to sexual redemption.<br><br>---<br><br></b><i>From a former client:<br></i>The resources Harry is making available to use in the local church will transform people&#x2019;s hearts and minds. <b>I am confident that the truth contained in these new resources will begin to shatter the strongholds that have held many captive for years.</b>&nbsp;If more people are exposed to this truth, hopefully the tide of self-help can be stemmed and the tide of clean heart, clean mind can begin to grow.</p></p><h2>The Quest for Environmental Justice: Human Rights and the Politics of Pollution</h2><p>This much anticipated follow-up to Dr. Robert D.

But if the commentary is a rarity, its subject matter&#x2014;the seven-line invocation of Padmasambhava&#x2014;is one of the best-known prayers in the Tibetan Buddhist world. <br><br>The overall significance of the Seven-Line Prayer is perhaps best appreciated in relation to a practice called guru-yoga, or "union with the nature of the guru." The purpose of guru-yoga is to purify and deepen the student's relationship with his or her teacher. It is introduced as one of the preliminary practices, and it remains crucial&#x2014;in fact, its importance increases&#x2014;as one progresses through the more advanced levels of the tantric path. The cultivation of devotion to the guru and the blending of one's mind with his or her enlightened mind is, in the words of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, "the most vital and necessary of all practices and is in itself the surest and fastest way to reach the goal of enlightenment." <br><br>Regarding the origin of this commentary, Mipham refers in the colophon to an event that triggered the abrupt appearance in his mind of the hidden meaning of the prayer. It is interesting to note that the language Mipham uses suggests that the commentary itself is not an ordinary composition but perhaps a treasure teaching, specifically a "mind-treasure" or <i>gongter.</i></p><p>Jamg�n Mipham (1846&#x2013;1912), one of the great luminaries of Tibetan Buddhism in modern times, has had a dominant and vitalizing influence on the Nyingma School and beyond.

A scholar of outstanding brilliance and versatility, his translated works are eagerly anticipated by English-language readers.&#x201c;Enshrining the most sacred prayer to Guru Padmasambhava, the Vajra Seven-Line Prayer, <i>White Lotus</i> elucidates its five layers of meaning as revealed by the eminent scholar Mipham the Great.

The book concludes with some practical "ranger-wisdom," illustrated with real-life examples, to help keep readers from becoming a "victim of their vacation" on their next outdoor excursion.</p>During three decades as a national park ranger, I had the opportunity to live and work in parks all across the country, from Montana to Texas and Arizona to Virginia. Along the way, I encountered a multitude of park visitors and an amazing variety of situations. Hey Ranger! recounts some of the most memorable and hilarious examples of those experiences.<br> <p>Park rangers are often greeted by the phrase "Hey Ranger!" but the way those two little words are spoken can convey a world of different meanings. Depending upon the circumstances, they might mean "Hi, how are you doing?" "Help, come quick!" or sometimes, "Oops, I sure didn't expect to see you here!" Frequently, the term heralds the reporting of a momentous or even bizarre event, and some of those situations are what this book is all about.<br> </p><p>Unlike many other books on recreational calamities, Hey Ranger! takes an entertaining new look at the lighter, rather than the tragic, side of outdoor misadventures. Some of the characters in these true stories have a narrow escape, but everybody survives in the end, and the result is fun, "family friendly" reading which everyone can enjoy.

The term underground is used in referring to the explorations with these substances, in the sense that they were hidden - out of respect for the restrictions and prohibitions of mainstream culture. These are ethnographic field reports, first-hand observations from an underground sub-culture, accompanied by the experiences of a selected number of participant-observers. It is important to recognize that in research with these and other so-called psychedelic or entheogenic substances, one cannot limit the observations and reflections solely to their physical and psychological effects. As most of the people cited here emphasize, the experiences with these substances at times can go far beyond their physical and psychological effects into the deepest and highest dimensions of our existence, both the cosmic and the spiritual.

He is brief, clear, and down to earth, covering the whole topic in under ninety pages of easy-to-read explanation. Those four reasons are God&#39;s silence, God&#39;s inaction, the lack of evidence, and the way the universe looks exactly like a godless universe would, and not at all like a Christian universe would, even down to its very structure. Dr. Carrier addresses all the usual replies to these claims, in ways you might not have heard before, relying on his wide experience in debating and studying these issues all over the world for more than fifteen years. A perfect book to introduce yourself, or your friends, to why fewer educated people are embracing Christianity than ever before. Ideal for handing out to door-to-door missionaries.</p><p>Richard Carrier is the renowned author of Sense and Goodness without God and Not the Impossible Faith, as well as numerous articles online and in print. He received his Ph.D. in ancient history from Columbia University in 2008, and now specializes in the modern philosophy of naturalism, the origins of Christianity, and the intellectual history of Greece and Rome.

Peter Atkins wants to change all that. <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> to Chemistry, he encourages us to look at chemistry anew, through a chemist's eyes, in order to understand its central concepts and to see how it contributes not only towards our material comfort, but also to human culture. Atkins shows how chemistry provides the infrastructure of our world, through the chemical industry, the fuels of heating, power generation, and transport, as well as the fabrics of our clothing and furnishings. <br><br>By considering the remarkable achievements that chemistry has made, and examining its place between both physics and biology, Atkins presents a fascinating, clear, and rigorous exploration of the world of chemistry - its structure, core concepts, and exciting contributions to new cutting-edge technologies. <br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong><br>The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

Although it covers many societies throughout time, the book does not attempt to tell all stories from all places, nor does it try to narrate "important" conflicts. Instead, author Wayne E. Lee describes the emergence of military innovations and systems, examining how they were created and then how they moved or affected other societies. These innovations are central to most historical narratives, including the development of social complexity, the rise of the state, the role of the steppe horseman, the spread of gunpowder, the rise of the west, the bureaucratization of military institutions, the industrial revolution and the rise of firepower, strategic bombing and nuclear weapons, and the creation of "people's war."<br></p><p><br><strong>Wayne E.

It broadcast its final song, Pink Floyd&#x2019;s &#x201c;Shine On You Crazy Diamond,&#x201d; in August 2009. In between, WBCN became the musical, cultural, and political voice of the young people of Boston and New England, sustaining a vibrant local music scene that launched such artists as the J. Geils Band, Aerosmith, James Taylor, Boston, the Cars, and the Dropkick Murphys, as well as paving the way for Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, U2, and many others. Along the way, WBCN both pioneered and defined progressive rock radio, the dominant format for a generation of listeners. Brilliantly told by Carter Alan&#x2015;and featuring the voices of station insiders and the artists they loved&#x2015;Radio Free Boston is the story of a city; of artistic freedom, of music and politics and identity; and of the cultural, technological, and financial forces that killed rock radio.</p><p>Currently a DJ and music director at WZLX in Boston, CARTER ALAN was a DJ at WBCN for nineteen years.

In this condition he plunges into the bustle of Lagos to make his fortune. With his red hair, green eyes, and pale skin, it seems he's been completely changed. Well, almost. There is the matter of his family, his accent, his name. Oh, and his black ass. Furo must quickly learn to navigate a world made unfamiliar and deal with those who would use him for their own purposes.

Wherever we look, the world is modelled on a simple template: like a steep pile of sand, it is poised on the brink of instability, with avalanches-- in events, ideas or whatever-- following a universal pattern of change. This remarkable discovery heralds what Mark Buchanan calls the new science of 'ubiquity', a science whose secret lies in the stuff of the everyday world.&nbsp;Combining literary flair with scientific rigour, this enthralling book documents the coming revolution by telling the story of the researchers' exploration of the law, their ingenious work and unexpected insights.<br><br>Buchanan reveals that we are witnessing the emergence of an extraordinarily powerful new field of science that will help us comprehend the bewildering and unruly rhythms that dominate our lives and may even lead to a true science of the dynamics of human culture and history.</p><p>Earthquakes, market crashes, hurricanes, wars: are these random forces of nature, or foreseeable blips on the radar screen of history? In this lively book, science journalist Mark Buchanan introduces readers to a developing branch of science that looks for order in what seems to be utmost chaos.<p> In the late 1980s, three physicists set out to investigate the apparently inherent instability of complex systems. In a process that Buchanan illustrates by analogy with a sand pile, they discovered that these systems tend to arrive at a "critical state," after which point any random grain falling in just the right place can touch off an avalanche. So it is, Buchanan shows us, with the onset of world wars, economic shocks, traffic gridlock, and other dislocating events--all of which this new science may one day help predict.</p><p> In clear and vigorous prose, Buchanan brings readers insights from nonequilibrium physics, offering a new way of seeing the "fingers of instability" that poke through the world's fabric--and that in turn make it such an interesting place. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Why do catastrophes happen? What sets off earthquakes, for example? What about mass extinctions of species? The outbreak of major wars? Massive traffic jams that seem to appear out of nowhere? Why does the stock market periodically suffer dramatic crashes? Why do some forest fires become superheated infernos that rage totally out of control? <br>Experts have never been able to explain the causes of any of these disasters. Now scientists have discovered that these seemingly unrelated cataclysms, both natural and human, almost certainly all happen for one fundamental reason. More than that, there is not and never will be any way to predict them. <br>Critically acclaimed science journalist Mark Buchanan tells the fascinating story of the discovery that there is a natural structure of instability woven into the fabric of our world. From humble beginnings studying the physics of sandpiles, scientists have learned that an astonishing range of things-Earth's crust, cars on a highway, the market for stocks, and the tightly woven networks of human society-have a natural tendency to organize themselves into what's called the "critical state," in which they are poised on what Buchanan describes as the "knife-edge of instability." The more places scientists have looked for the critical state, the more places they've found it, and some believe that the pervasiveness of instability must now be seen as a fundamental feature of our world. <br>Ubiquity is packed with stories of real-life catastrophes, such as the huge earthquake that in 1995 hit Kobe, Japan, killing 5,000 people; the forest fires that ravaged Yellowstone National Park in 1988; the stock market crash of 1987; the mass extinction thatkilled off the dinosaurs; and the outbreak of World War I. Combining literary flair with scientific rigor, Buchanan introduces the researchers who have pieced together the evidence of the critical state, explaining their ingenious work and unexpected insights in beautifully lucid prose. <br>At the dawn of this new century, Buchanan reveals, we are witnessing the emergence of an extraordinarily powerful new field of science that will help us comprehend the bewildering and unruly rhythms that dominate our lives and may even lead to a true science of the dynamics of human culture and history. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>Ontological Terror: Blackness, Nihilism, and Emancipation</h2><p>In <i>Ontological Terror</i> Calvin L. Warren intervenes in Afro-pessimism, Heideggerian metaphysics, and black humanist philosophy by positing that the "Negro question" is intimately imbricated with questions of Being. Warren uses the figure of the antebellum free black as a philosophical paradigm for thinking through the tensions between blackness and Being. He illustrates how blacks embody a metaphysical nothing. This nothingness serves as a destabilizing presence and force as well as that which whiteness defines itself against. Thus, the function of blackness as giving form to nothing presents a terrifying problem for whites: they need blacks to affirm their existence, even as they despise the nothingness they represent. By pointing out how all humanism is based on investing blackness with nonbeing&#x2014;a logic which reproduces antiblack violence and precludes any realization of equality, justice, and recognition for blacks&#x2014;Warren urges the removal of the human from its metaphysical pedestal and the exploration of ways of existing that are not predicated on a grounding in being.</p><p>Calvin L. Warren is Assistant Professor of Women&#39;s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Emory University.&#x201c;In this careful and cogent account of the metaphysical structures of antiblack violence, Calvin L. Warren introduces a much-needed philosophical intervention in the claims and propositions of Afro-pessimism. His superb intellectual skills and beautiful philosophizing make this magnificent work important to a whole generation of scholars.&#x201d; -- Denise Ferreira da Silva, author of, <i>Toward a Global Idea of Race</i></p><h2>Magritte: The Mystery of the Ordinary, 1926-1938</h2><p>Published in conjunction with a major exhibition organized by The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in collaboration with The Menil Collection, Houston, and The Art Institute of Chicago, <i>Magritte: The Mystery of the Ordinary, 1926&#x2013;1938</i> focuses on the breakthrough Surrealist years of Ren� Magritte, creator of some of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most extraordinary images. Bringing together nearly 80 paintings, collages and objects with a selection of photographs, periodicals and early commercial work, it offers fresh insight into Magritte&#x2019;s identity as a modern artist and one of Surrealism&#x2019;s greatest painters. Beginning in 1926, when Magritte first aimed to create paintings that would, in his words, &#x201c;challenge the real world,&#x201d; and concluding in 1938--a historically and biographically significant moment just before the outbreak of World War II--the publication traces central strategies and themes from this seminal period, particularly those of displacement, isolation, transformation, metamorphosis, the &#x201c;misnaming&#x201d; of objects and the representation of visions seen in half-waking states. The publication also includes an illustrated chronology outlining significant moments in the artist&#x2019;s life during this period, including travel, connections with other Surrealist artists and writers, contributions to journals and important exhibitions and reviews.</p><p>This installation of the Modern Master series surveys the work of Rene Magritte, one of the most enigmatic artists of the 20th century and an important figure in the surrealist movement. He combined the commonplace with the fantastic to become the master of &#34;magic realism.&#34; Cloud-filled skies, bowler-hatted men, and oversized household objects are in abundance in the more than 60 full-color reproductions included in this volume.Rene Magritte was born RenE FranAois-Ghislain Magritte in 1898 in Belgium. In March of 1912, Magritte&#39;s mother killed herself by jumping into the river Sambre. The next year, the young artist met his future wife, Georgette Berger; the year after that he enrolled as a pupil at the Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels. In the early 1920s, Magritte served in the military, married Georgette, and worked as a graphic artist, primarily drawing motifs for wallpaper. De Chirico provided a strong early influence. Magritte&#39;s first painting, a portrait of singer Evelyne BrElia, was sold in 1923, and his first surrealist work, Le Jockey Perdu, was painted in 1926. His first exhibition was held in 1927; soon thereafter, he and Georgette moved near Paris and began to meet other surrealists like MirU, Eluard and Arp. His relationships with the surrealists only deepened over the following years: Magritte published his work in various surrealist journals, vacationed with the DalIs, and exhibited with Edward James. At different points during his mature career, he dramatically changed his painting style, only to return to his original surrealist ways. Magritte died in 1967.</p><h2>Concerning the Book that is the Body of the Beloved</h2><p><p>&#x201c;The heart of Orr&#x2019;s poetry, now as ever, is the enigmatic image . . . mystical, carnal, reflective, wry.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>San Francisco Review</i></p><p>This book-length sequence of ecstatic, visionary lyrics recalls Rumi in its search for the beloved and its passionate belief in the healing qualities of art and beauty.</p><p><i>Concerning the Book that is the Body of the Beloved</i> is an incantatory celebration of the &#x201c;Book,&#x201d; an imaginary and self-gathering anthology of all the lyrics&#x2014;both poems and songs&#x2014;ever written.

The first poem invokes the Egyptian god Osiris, whose lover Isis resurrected him by collecting his scattered parts: "We must find them... As an anthologist might collect/ All the poems that matter," Orr intones. As he pursues that goal, however, his own poems can be overbroad in focus: "The heart knows all/ These songs/ And a million of its own," one poem says. "The risk is always there," a later poem states, "And the challenge, too: To take it in, to feel it, and then/ To speak it back in poems and songs." "When the beloved dies," he explains later, "It's only to ask more of you,/ So you become richer from giving." Near the end, Orr describes his own poetry as "a silent saying/ Of all/ We hold dear." Poems about earlier poets (Sappho, Emily Dickinson, Apollinaire) add detail but fail to change the tone. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The twelve were Miss Martin's prized charity girls, supported at the school partly by the fees of the others and partly by generous donations from an anonymous benefactor. This benefactor had kept the school afloat when it would have been forced to close its doors several years ago for lack of funds and had enabled Miss Martin to achieve her dream of being able to offer an education to the indigent as well as the more well heeled. Over the years the school had acquired a reputation for providing a good and broad academic education to young ladies of all social classes.<br><br>The charity girls had nowhere else to go during the holidays, and so two or more of the resident teachers were forced to remain in order to care for them and entertain them until school resumed.<br><br>This summer all three resident teachers had remained&#x2013;Miss Martin herself, Susanna Osbourne, and Anne Jewell.<br><br>Miss Martin and Miss Jewell strode along at the back of the line of girls.

Her son, David, was sandwiched between two of the girls, and chattered away merrily to them though they were both several years older than he.<br><br>"Why you would give up a chance to take tea in the cramped confines of Sally Lunn's with twelve noisy, giggly schoolgirls in order to take it in the refined atmosphere of an elegant, spacious drawing room with the rich and titled, I do not know, Anne," Miss Martin said dryly.<br><br>Anne laughed.<br><br>"I was specifically invited for today," she said, "but you would not put off the visit to Sally Lunn's until tomorrow. It was very unsporting of you, Claudia."<br><br>"Very <i>practical</i> of me," Miss Martin retorted. "I would have been strung up from the nearest tree by my thumbs if I had suggested any such postponement. So would you and Susanna. But really, Anne, taking tea with Lady Potford is one thing. She has been kind enough to you in the past. But to take tea with <i>that woman</i>!"<br><br>By <i>that woman</i> she meant the Marchioness of Hallmere, the former Lady Freyja Bedwyn, sister of the Duke of Bewcastle. Miss Martin had once been governess to Lady Freyja, who had frightened away a whole string of governesses before her. Miss Martin had left too, but more in outrage than in fright. She had left in the middle of the day, on foot, carrying all her worldly possessions with her, having refused either severance pay or a letter of recommendation or transportation from the Duke of Bewcastle. She had figuratively thumbed her nose at the lot of them.<br><br>Anne had been invited to take tea with Lady Potford on Great Pulteney Street because Lady Potford's grandson, Joshua Moore, the Marquess of Hallmere, was in town staying with her&#x2013;as were his wife and children.<br><br>"I have been invited because of Joshua," Anne said. "You know how good he has always been to me and David, Claudia."<br><br>He had been her friend at a time when the whole world had turned against her&#x2013;or so it had seemed. He had even provided her with some financial support for several years when she was close to being destitute, giving rise to the very distressing and quite erroneous rumor that he must be David's father. To say that he had been good to her was markedly to understate the case.<br><br>Susanna had started the girls singing a song in rounds, and they sang out lustily, heedless of any attention they might draw from passersby. Miss Martin, severe looking and ramrod straight in posture, did not blink an eye.<br><br>"And if I had suspected for <i>one moment</i>," she said, "when you applied for the position of mathematics and geography teacher here four years ago, Anne, that <i>that woman</i> had suggested this school to you, I would not have hired you in a million years. She came to the school a few months before that, snooping around with her offensive, supercilious air, noting every worn spot on the carpet in the visitors' parlor, I do not doubt, and asking if I needed anything. The nerve of it! I sent her packing in a hurry, I do not mind telling you."<br><br>Anne half smiled. She had heard the story a dozen times before, and all of Miss Martin's resident teachers knew of her undying antipathy toward the aristocracy, particularly toward those unfortunate enough to bear the title of duke, and most particularly to the one who bore the title Duke of Bewcastle. But Lady Hallmere came in a very close second on her blacklist.<br><br>"She has her good points," Anne said.<br><br>Claudia Martin made a sound that resembled a snort.<br><br>"The least said on that point the better," she said. "But lest you misunderstand, Anne, I am not one whit sorry that I did hire you, and so I suppose it was just as well that at the time I did not understand the connection between Lydmere in Cornwall, where you came from, the Marquess of Hallmere, who lived at nearby Penhallow, and Lady Freyja Bedwyn. <i>Miss Osbourne</i>."<br><br>Her voice rose above all other sounds as the girls paused in their rounds, and Susanna turned a bright, laughing face and halted the line.<br><br>"Lady Potford's, I believe," Miss Martin said, indicating the house next to which they had stopped. "I would rather you than me, Anne, but have fun."<br><br>David detached himself from his position in the line to join Anne, Susanna grinned at her, and the crocodile continued on its way toward Sally Lunn's beyond the abbey on the other side of the river.<br><br>"Good-bye, David," a few of the girls called, bolder than they would normally have been when out in public&#x2013;the holiday spirit prevailed. "Good-bye, Miss Jewell. Wish you were coming too."<br><br>Claudia Martin rolled her eyes and struck off after her cherished girls.<br>As Miss Martin had just indicated, it was not the first time Anne had called upon Lady Potford at her home on Great Pulteney Street. She had called here&#x2013;with some trepidation&#x2013;with a letter of introduction four years ago when she first came to teach at Miss Martin's school and she had been invited to return several times since.<br><br>But today was a special occasion, and looking down at nine-year-old David after she had rapped the knocker against the door, Anne could see the light of excited anticipation in his eyes. The Marquess of Hallmere was his favorite person in the world even though they did not often see each other. Joshua had been invariably kind to him, though, when they <i>had</i> met&#x2013;twice when Anne and David had been invited to spend a week of a school holiday at Penhallow, the marquess's country seat in Cornwall, and twice when the marquess had been in Bath and had called at the school to take David out in his curricle. And he never forgot to send gifts for birthdays and Christmas.<br><br>Anne smiled down at her son as they waited for the butler to open the door. He was growing up fast, she thought ruefully. He was no longer an infant.<br><br>He behaved rather like one, though, when they stepped inside and could see that the marquess was coming down the stairs to meet them, grinning cheerfully. David dashed toward him, all childish eagerness and voluble chatter, and was swept off his feet and spun about in a circle while he laughed joyfully.<br><br>Anne, looking on, felt an almost painful constriction about the heart. She had poured out a mother's love on her son for nine years, but of course she had never been able to provide him with a father's love too.<br><br>"Lad," the marquess said, setting David back down on his feet, "you must have a few bricks in the sole of each shoe. You weigh a ton. Or maybe it is just that you are growing up. Let me see now. You must be . . . twelve?"<br><br>"No!" David chuckled gleefully.<br><br>"Never tell me you are thirteen?"<br><br>"No! I am <i>nine</i>!"<br><br>"Nine? Only nine? I am speechless with amazement." The marquess ruffled David's hair with one hand and turned his smile on Anne.<br><br>"Joshua," she said, "how good it is to see you."<br><br>He was a tall, well-formed man, with blond hair, a handsome, good-natured face, and blue eyes that almost constantly smiled. Anne had always loved him with feelings that had occasionally bordered on the romantic, though she had never allowed them to spill over into passion. As plain Joshua Moore he had also been her friend when she was a governess at his aunt and uncle's house and after she had been dismissed. His friendship had been of infinitely more worth to her than any unrequited passion might have been.<br><br>Besides, she had loved another man when she first became acquainted with Joshua Moore. She had even had an understanding with that man and considered herself betrothed to him.<br><br>"Anne." He took both her hands in his and squeezed them tightly. "You are in remarkably good looks. The Bath air must suit you."<br><br>"It does," she assured him. "How is Lady Hallmere? And how are the children?"<br><br>"Freyja is in the drawing room," he said. "You will see her in a moment. Daniel and Emily are with their nurse upstairs. You must see them before you leave. Daniel has declared at least two dozen times in the last hour that he simply cannot wait another moment for David to come." He looked at David with an apologetic grin. "A three-year-old will not be much of a playmate for you, lad, but if you can find it in your heart to entertain him for a short while, or to allow him to entertain you, you will make him the happiest child alive."<br><br>"I would love to play with him, sir," David said.<br><br>"Good lad." Joshua ruffled his hair again. "But come and pay your respects in the drawing room first. It is only very young children who are whisked off straight to the nursery and you certainly do not fall into that category, do you?"<br><br>"No, sir," David said as Joshua offered Anne his arm and winked at her.<br><br>Lady Potford received them graciously in the drawing room, and Lady Hallmere got to her feet to nod in acknowledgment of David's bow and to look assessingly at Anne.<br><br>"You look well, Miss Jewell," she said.<br><br>"Thank you, Lady Hallmere," Anne said, curtsying to her.<br><br>She had always found the marchioness rather intimidating, with her small stature and strange, rather harsh, rather handsome features. She had disliked her on first acquaintance and considered her quite unsuited to the kindhearted, easygoing Joshua. But then she had discovered that her former pupil, Lady Prudence Moore, Joshua's mentally handicapped cousin, adored Lady Freyja, who had been unexpectedly kind to her. Prue had always been a good judge of character. And then Lady Freyja, recognizing that Anne was living only a half-existence as an unwed mother and would-be teacher in the small fishing village of Lydmere, had appeared on her doorstep one morning and offered her a position at Miss Martin's school, of which she was the anonymous benefactor.<br><br>If Claudia Martin ever discovered that truth, there would be trouble! Anne had, of course, been sworn to secrecy.<br><br>She had grown to respect, like, and even admire Lady Hallmere&#x2013;and her marriage to Joshua appeared to be a love match.<br><br>For several minutes David was the focus of attention as he answered questions, seated beside Joshua and gazing almost worshipfully up at his hero. Then, just before the tea tray was brought in, he was sent up to the nursery, where he was promised fairy cakes and lemonade.<br><br>"We have just come from Lindsey Hall," Joshua explained to Anne as the tea was being poured, "and a grand family celebration for the christening of Bewcastle's son and heir."<br><br>"I trust he is a healthy child," Anne said politely, "and that the duchess has recovered her health."<br><br>"Both." Joshua grinned. "I do believe the new Marquess of Lindsey is going to be worthy of the Bedwyn name. He has a powerful set of lungs and has no hesitation at all in using them to get whatever he wishes."<br><br>"And now," Lady Hallmere added, "we are all on our way to Wales for a month. Bewcastle has an estate there and was planning a brief visit. But the duchess insisted upon accompanying him, and then we all decided to go too since it was far too soon to disperse and go our separate ways."<br><br>"A holiday by the sea is a pleasant prospect," Joshua said with a grin, "despite the fact that <i>we</i> live within a stone's throw of it in Cornwall. But the Bedwyns are not often all together, and all our children were in such transports of delight at having one another with whom to play and quarrel at Lindsey Hall that it seemed almost cruel to deprive them of one another's company for a month or so longer."<br><br>How lovely it must be, Anne thought wistfully, to belong to a large, close-knit, boisterous family. How lovely for the children.<br><br>"School has finished for the year, Miss Jewell?" Lady Potford asked.<br><br>"Most of the girls went home yesterday, ma'am," Anne told her.<br><br>"And will you be going home too?" Lady Potford asked.<br><br>"No, ma'am," Anne said. "I will remain at the school. Miss Martin takes in charity pupils as well as paying ones, and they must be cared for through the holidays."<br><br>Of course, there was no need for Claudia, Susanna, and Anne all to remain. But none of them had anywhere else to go unless their close friend Frances Marshall, Countess of Edgecombe, a former teacher at the school, arrived home from the Continent, where she had gone with the earl on a singing tour, and invited one of them to Barclay Court in Somersetshire, as she often did whenever she was at home during a school holiday.</p><h2>The Intern Blues: The Timeless Classic About the Making of a Doctor</h2><p><p>While supervising a small group of interns at a major New York medical center, Dr. Robert Marion asked three of them to keep a careful diary over the course of a year.

As if the grand dome wasn&#x2019;t grand enough, it&#x2019;s topped with an ornate steeple and a torch that lights up at night when the City Council is meeting.<br>&nbsp;The building always struck me as garish and pompous rather than majestic and imposing. I guess that&#x2019;s fitting for a place that houses mostly politicians and bureaucrats.<br>&nbsp;But standing in Mayor Smitrovich&#x2019;s office, I felt like I was in an aquarium. There were tarpon, swordfish, and Dorados mounted on the walls, their mouths agape, forever twisting in midthrash. A pair of window cleaners worked outside, peering in at us from the other side of the glass behind the mayor. All that was missing to make the effect complete were a ceramic mermaid and a castle for us to swim around.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a real pleasure to finally meet you, Mr. Monk,&#x201d; Smitrovich said, coming around the desk and shaking Monk&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a big fan.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;I handed Monk a moist towelette.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Monk said, wiping his hand.<br>&#x201c;I truly appreciate your tireless efforts on behalf of this city.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s such a relief. I was beginning to think you were ignoring all my letters,&#x201d; Monk said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about time someone in authority ended our city&#x2019;s shame and turned Lombard from the world&#x2019;s crookedest street to the straightest.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You want to straighten Lombard?&#x201d; the mayor said.<br>&#x201c;Whoever approved that street should have been beaten with his T-square,&#x201d; Monk said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good thing he was stopped before every street in the city looked like Lombard. It&#x2019;s astonishing to me that nobody has ever bothered to correct it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know how it is, Mr. Monk,&#x201d; the mayor said. &#x201c;There are so many other pressing issues that demand our attention.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What could be more important than that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; the mayor said, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s why I asked you here today.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not straightening Lombard?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not just yet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;ll face some opposition from a wacko minority of hippies and beatniks. But I&#x2019;ll back you one hundred percent.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s reassuring, because I truly need your support,&#x201d; the mayor said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s clear to me that we both share a deep and abiding love for this great city.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be great as long as the world&#x2019;s crookedest street is here,&#x201d; Monk said. &#x201c;What would be great is a city with the world&#x2019;s straightest street. Just think of all the tourists who would come here to see it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Millions of tourists do come to see Lombard Street,&#x201d; the mayor said.<br>&#x201c;To ridicule us,&#x201d; Monk said. &#x201c;Where do you think the phrase &#x2018;those crazy Americans&#x2019; came from? Lombard Street. Fix the street and they&#x2019;ll never say it again.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Right now, I&#x2019;m more concerned about the lack of police officers reporting to work. Most of the patrol officers are on the job; it&#x2019;s the detectives and supervisory personnel who aren&#x2019;t showing up,&#x201d; the mayor said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s creating a serious public safety issue. We don&#x2019;t have the manpower to investigate major felonies. You know how important the first forty-eight hours are in an investigation. Tracks are getting cold. Something must be done about this, especially with this strangler on the loose. They couldn&#x2019;t have picked a worse time to pull this crap.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You could drop your demands for big cuts in police salaries and benefits,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I bet that would bring the detectives back to work.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure, I could give the police officers what they want,&#x201d; the mayor said, shooting me an angry look before shifting his gaze back to Monk, &#x201c;but then where would the money come from to straighten Lombard Street?&#x201d;<br>Monk glanced at me. &#x201c;He has a point.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, he doesn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;With all due respect, Mr. Smitrovich, these people lay their lives on the line for us. We owe them a decent wage, affordable medical care, and a comfortable retirement.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And what should I tell the sewer workers, the schoolteachers, and the firefighters who aren&#x2019;t enjoying the same benefits, Miss Teeger? And what do I tell the citizens who want new schools and cleaner, safer, straighter streets?&#x201d;<br>The last bit was clearly for Monk&#x2019;s benefit, but Monk wasn&#x2019;t paying attention. He was tipping this way and that, trying to peer around the mayor.<br>The mayor looked over his shoulder to see what was distracting Monk. All he saw were two window cleaners running their blades across the glass, wiping away the soap.<br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t invite Mr. Monk down here to give him the city&#x2019;s party line on the labor negotiations,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You want something from him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true, I do,&#x201d; the mayor said, addressing Monk. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like your help solving the city&#x2019;s homicides.&#x201d;<br>But Monk was busy waving at the window cleaners. They waved back. Monk waved again. They waved back. Monk waved again and they ignored him.<br>&#x201c;Mr. Monk consults for the police because of his special relationship with Captain Stottlemeyer,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not going to work for another detective.&#x201d;<br>I looked at Monk for confirmation, but now he was wiping the air with his hand palm-out in front of him. The window cleaners finally understood and soaped the window again. Monk smiled approvingly as they wiped it again with their blades.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want him to work for any other detectives,&#x201d; the mayor said. &#x201c;I want them to work for him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;I want to reinstate him in the San Francisco Police Department,&#x201d; the mayor said. &#x201c;And promote him to captain of the Homicide Division.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is this some kind of joke?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Because if it is, it&#x2019;s cruel.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m completely serious,&#x201d; the mayor said.<br>Monk marched over to the window and tapped on the glass. &#x201c;You missed a spot.&#x201d;<br>The window cleaners shrugged. They couldn&#x2019;t hear him. He mimed spraying the window and wiping the glass in front of him again. They shook their heads no.<br>I looked at the mayor. &#x201c;Now I know you&#x2019;re joking.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got a better solve rate than all the detectives in the homicide department put together, and at a fraction of the cost. With Monk at the helm, the homicide department could do the same job or better than they&#x2019;ve been doing, with half as many men. Besides, I think he&#x2019;s ready for command.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are we talking about the same man?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Look at him.&#x201d;<br>Monk shook his head at the cleaners and pointed to the spot they had just cleaned. The two cleaners started hoisting their platform up to the next floor. Monk banged on the glass.<br>&#x201c;Get back down here,&#x201d; Monk yelled.<br>The mayor smiled. &#x201c;I see a man with an incredible eye for detail and a commitment to sticking with a task until it&#x2019;s done right.&#x201d;<br>Monk turned to me. I hoped he&#x2019;d finally say something about the mayor&#x2019;s outrageous offer.<br>&#x201c;I need a wipe,&#x201d; Monk said.<br>&#x201c;Excuse us for a moment,&#x201d; I said to the mayor, then went over to Monk and handed him a wipe. &#x201c;Did you hear what the mayor just said?&#x201d;<br>Monk tore open the packet, took out the wipe, and began scrubbing the glass with it.<br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; I asked.<br>Monk looked at his wipe and shook his head. &#x201c;Silly me, the stain was inside.&#x201d;&nbsp; He turned to the mayor and held up the wipe. &#x201c;Crisis solved. You can relax now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then you&#x2019;ll take the job?&#x201d; the mayor said.<br>&#x201c;What job?&#x201d; Monk asked.<br>&#x201c;Captain of the Homicide Division,&#x201d; the mayor said.<br>Monk looked at the wipe in astonishment, then at me. &#x201c;This was all I had to do?

In her eye-opening and effective new book, MBS expert Liz Dean reveals how the key to transforming those dreams into reality lies not in our conscious actions, but in our subconscious thoughts. By aligning the two, we can unleash our own power to lose weight, organise our lives, work more efficiently in our jobs and so much more. Switch Words is this simple yet incredibly powerful tool to help you get there.</p><p>The greatest obstacle in achieving your goals is your subconscious. Whilst your conscious mind knows what you want and how to get it, experience tells us our subconscious mind can often ignore or sabotage our desires through action or inaction. Have you ever created a meal plan to help you lose weight, but then a couple of days later found yourself inching to the fridge for a snack at 9pm? Even though you were desperate to achieve the body image you wanted, part of you, for some reason, resisted.</p><p>This is because the words we use when expressing our goals and dreams have unique vibrations which the conscious mind understands &#x2013; but the subconscious needs a different language in order to respond positively and get with the programme. Through easy-to-follow practices and techniques, Dean guides you to acknowledge the power your sub-conscious can have over everyday actions, how to extract the right switch words to resonate your conscious desire with your subconscious thoughts, and how to use them effectively day to day.</p><p>Methodical and verifiably successful, switch words is the effective way to get what you want, and this book will show you how.</p></p><p><p>Liz Dean is author of thirteen books and card decks.

But when he is found dead of an apparent drug overdose, constable Hamish Macbeth suspects foul play. Teaming with Glasgow Detective Inspector Olivia Chater, Macbeth goes undercover and dives into the underworld to root out a cartel secretly entrenched in the Highlands.</p><p>M.C. Beaton's Hamish Macbeth doesn't fit everyone's idea of a cozy mystery hero. The police constable prefers his flock of Highland sheep and fine single-malt Scotch to cats and cups of tea, and the details of his success with women would bring a maidenly blush to Miss Marple's cheek. Yet his charm is definitely of the soft-boiled variety. <i>Death of an Addict</i>, Beaton's 15th book in this series, begins with the apparent overdose death of Tommy Jarret, a recovering heroin addict who was writing an autobiography. Hamish, who oversees law and order in the village of Lochdubh, is instantly suspicious of the circumstances. Told to back off the case, he picks it up again on the sly when the dead man's parents ask him to find out what happened. Hamish's apparent lack of ambition masks a keen nose for illegal activity; even the dead ends of his investigation reveal a loan-sharking operation and a cache of hallucinogenic mushrooms.<p> Hamish's biggest fish is drug baron Jimmy White. To reel White in, Hamish poses as a drug supplier, with a beautiful, standoffish detective inspector from Glasgow playing the part of his wife. The pair go off on a whirlwind trip to Amsterdam to maintain their front, leading to a comic mishap and the beginnings of a romance--one that nearly comes to a very bad end when White is tipped off by Hamish's enemy, Detective Inspector Blair. </p><p> Mystery buffs new to the series will find this Highland fling easy to follow, and those who are already fans will delight in the hint of a new long-term relationship for their laconic hero. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>M. C. Beaton has won international acclaim for her New York Times bestselling Hamish Macbeth mysteries. The BBC has aired 24 episodes based on the series.

This can perhaps be attributed to the fact that Leiter saw himself for a long time mainly as a painter.</p><p>After coming to New York in 1946, he exhibited alongside abstract expressionists like Willem de Kooning before beginning in the late 1940s to take photographs. Like Robert Frank or Helen Levitt, he found his motifs on the streets of New York, but at the same time was visibly interested in abstraction. Edward Steichen was one of the first to discover Leiter's photography, showing it in the 1950s in two important exhibitions at New York's Museum of Modern Art. Back then color photography was regarded as "low art," fit only for advertising. Leiter accordingly worked primarily as a fashion photographer, for magazines such as <i>Esquire</i> and <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>. Nearly forty years would go by before his extraordinary artistic color photography was rediscovered.</p><p>This book, published to mark the first major retrospective of Leiter's work anywhere in the world, features for the first time, in addition to his early black and white and color images, his fashion photography, the overpainted nudes, as well as his paintings and sketchbooks.</p></p><p><b>Brigitte Woischnik</b> is owner of the agency Foto Factory in Munich, Germany.

This &#x201c;abounding, ebullient, effervescent emotion&#x201d; manifests itself everywhere from child&#x2019;s play to scientific breakthrough and is crucially important to learning, risk-taking, social cohesiveness, and survival itself. <b>Exuberance: The Passion for Life</b> introduces us to such notably irrepressible types as Teddy Roosevelt, John Muir, and Richard Feynman, as well as Peter Pan, dancing porcupines, and Charles Schulz&#x2019;s Snoopy. It explores whether exuberance can be inherited, parses its neurochemical grammar, and documents the methods people have used to stimulate it. The resulting book is an irresistible fusion of science and soul.</p><p>The author of the bestselling "An Unquiet Mind-and internationally renowned authority on mood disorders-now gives us something wonderfully different: an exploration of exuberance and how it fuels our most important creative and scientific achievements. <br>John Muir's lifelong passion to save America's wild places, Wilson Bentley's legendary obsession to record for posterity the beauty of individual snowflakes, the boundless scientific curiosity behind Watson and Crick's discovery of DNA, sea lions that surf and porcupines that dance-Kay Redfield Jamison shows how these and many more examples both human and animal define the nature of exuberance, and how this exuberance relates to intellectual searching, risk-taking, creativity, and survival itself. She examines the hereditary predisposition to exuberance; the role of the brain chemical dopamine; the connection between positive moods and psychological resilience; and the differences between exuberance and mania. She delves into some of the phenomena of exuberance-the contagiousness of laughter, the giddiness of new love, the intoxicating effects of music and of religious ecstasy-while also addressing the dangerous desire to simulate exuberance by using drugs or alcohol. In a fascinating and intimate coda to the rest of the book, renowned scientists, writers, and politicians share their thoughts on the forms and role of exuberance in their own lives. <br>Original, inspiring, authoritative, "Exuberance brims with the very energy and passion that it celebrates. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p><b>KAY REDFIELD JAMISON</b>&nbsp;is a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine as well as an honorary professor of English at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.

Latinx Studies. Women's Studies. Translated from the Spanish by Suzanne Jill Levine and Aviva Kana. A fairy tale run amok, THE TAIGA SYNDROME follows an unnamed female Ex-Detective as she searches for a couple who has fled to the far reaches of the earth. A betrayed husband is convinced by a brief telegram that his second ex-wife wants him to track her downthat she wants to be found. He hires the Ex-Detective, who sets out with a translator into a snowy, hostile forest where strange things happen and translation betrays both sense and one's senses. Tales of Hansel and Gretel and Little Red Riding Hood haunt the Ex-Detective's quest, though the lessons of her journey are more experiential than moral: that just as love can fly away, sometimes unloving flies away as well. That sometimes leaving everything behind is the only thing left to do.</p><p>Cristina Rivera Garza is the award-winning author of numerous works of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction.

You use them to sit on a lotus flower and say goodbye to the immensity') and as fantastic as a fairy tale, Rivera Garza's gorgeous, propulsive novel will haunt readers long after it's finished."&#x2014;<strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em>, [starred review]</strong><br><br>"This insanely creepy &amp; brilliant book by the incomparable Cristina Rivera Garza will keep you awake at night. Garza is a master of atmosphere. A detective novel directed by David Lynch &amp; narrated by Bola�o."&#x2014;<strong>Mark Haber, Brazos Bookstore</strong><br><br>"This novel, in a translation by Levine and Kana, is taught, lyrical, and strange, and it fits right in with Dorothy, A Publishing Project's commitment to work that challenges what genres and forms can do. Like the best speculative fiction, it follows the sinuous paths of its own logic but gives the reader plenty of room to play. Fans of fairy tales and detective stories, Kathryn Davis and Idra Novey, will all find something to love. An eerie, slippery gem of a book."&#x2014;<strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em>, [starred review]</strong><br><br>"Mystery, sci-fi, Socratic dialogue, retelling of 'Hansel and Gretel': <em>The Taiga Syndrome</em> is a delightful shape-shifter of a novel."&#x2014;<strong>Jonathan Woollen, Politics &amp; Prose</strong><br><br>"The contemporary Latin American detective novel is a form that uses the individual's rollicking quest as a means of resistance against repressive structures and the violences they engender. Cristina Rivera Garza's <em>The Taiga Syndrome</em>, in this stellar translation by Suzanne Jill Levine and Aviva Kana, gives English-language readers a lyrically luminous take on the genre while not skimping on its adventurous antics. If <em>The Taiga Syndrome</em> is a book of illness, it's also about exile, disappearance, borders, love, language and translation, desire, capitalism and its discontents, fairy tales, and what it means to be possessed by the madness of others and the madness of ourselves. The murmurs that haunt the detective in <em>The Taiga Syndrome</em> evoke the history of Mexican fiction, most notably Juan Rulfo. But this is not a religious state of purgatory. It's more like <em>Apocalypse Now</em> fused with the worlds of Clarice Lispector and Jorge Luis Borges. In other words, there is no one writing novels as phantasmagorically exquisite as Cristina Rivera Garza's. <em>The Taiga Syndrome</em>, which is both quietly poetic and narratively unhinged, is a crucial addition to her distinguished oeuvre."&#x2014;<strong>Daniel Borzutzky</strong><br><br>"[A]n explosive writer yet to be fully accounted for in English."&#x2014;<strong>Lina Meruane</strong><br><br>"Cristina Rivera Garza does not respect what is expected of a writer, of a novel, of language.

He enlisted in the Granite Mountain Hotshots, a team of elite firefighters based in Prescott, Arizona. Their leader, Eric Marsh, was in a desperate crunch after four hotshots left the unit, and perhaps seeing a glimmer of promise in the skinny would-be recruit, he took a chance on the unlikely McDonough, and the chance paid off. Despite the crew's skepticism, and thanks in large part to Marsh's firm but loving encouragement, McDonough unlocked a latent drive and dedication, going on to successfully battle a number of blazes and eventually win the confidence of the men he came to call his brothers.<br><br>Then, on June 30, 2013, while McDonough--"Donut" as he'd been dubbed by his team--served as lookout, they confronted a freak, 3,000-degree inferno in nearby Yarnell, Arizona. The relentless firestorm ultimately trapped his hotshot brothers, tragically killing all 19 of them within minutes. Nationwide, it was the greatest loss of firefighter lives since the 9/11 attacks. <br><br><i>Granite Mountain</i> is a gripping memoir that traces McDonough's story of finding his way out of the dead end of drugs, finding his purpose among the Granite Mountain Hotshots, and the minute-by-minute account of the fateful day he lost the very men who had saved him. A harrowing and redemptive tale of resilience in the face of tragedy, <i>Granite Mountain</i> is also a powerful reminder of the heroism of the people who put themselves in harm's way to protect us every day.<br></p><p><strong>Brendan McDonough</strong> is the only survivor of the 2013 fire at Yarnell.

He lives in Montclair, New Jersey.<br><br>"<em>My Lost Brothers</em> is a harrowing story of heroism in the face of natural disaster. It perfectly illustrates the kind of teamwork and camaraderie that informed the legendary squad of hotshots working to save--in this case--their hometown from utter destruction by fire. As perhaps the least likely guy ever to become a hotshot, Brendan McDonough more than lives up to his role after having been taken underwing by Granite Mountain leader Eric Marsh. That he has been able to keep on even keel as the Yarnell Hill Fire's lone survivor, having lost his mentor and his best friends, speaks volumes about his character and is a lasting testimony to the strength of his lost brothers."&#x2015;<b><i>Ed Viesturs, bestselling author of <i>The Mountain: My Time on Everest</i></i></b><br><br>"Gear up with Brendan McDonough and his brothers in the elite Granite Mountain crew of wildland firefighters.

Powerful and lasting, this is a story of men who gave their all."&#x2015;<b><i>Adam Makos, <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling author of <i>A Higher Call</i></i></b><br><br>"With his insightful barbs aimed at our increasingly unrealistic ideal of life in the West and the many ways in which wildland firefighters are let down by those who fund and rely upon them, and brutally honest assessment of his struggles with PTSD, McDonough gives readers a unique and bracing literary experience.&#x2015;<b><i><em>Booklist</em></i></b><br><br>"The dangers of battling fires on the ground and air are many and McDonough thrillingly explains the terror and panic of the fateful June 30, 2013 tragedy at Yarnell Hill, where all 19 of his crew members perished, leaving him with painful survivor's guilt.

It always snowed--if it snowed at all--before Christmas, when people were trying to travel to family gatherings or house parties, or long after Christmas, when it was a mere nuisance to people trying to go about the business of their everyday lives. It never snowed actually on Christmas, when it would have added a picturesque quality and some magic to the celebrations.<br><br>Such was the sad reality of living in England.<br><br>This year had been no exception. The skies had remained stubbornly gray and heavy with the promise of something dire all over the holiday, and the weather had been chilly and blustery and really not very pleasant at all. But the ground had remained obstinately bare and as drab as the sky.<br><br>It had been a rather dreary Christmas, if the truth were told.<br><br>Frances Allard, who had made the long day's journey from Bath, where she taught at Miss Martin's School for Girls on Sutton and Daniel streets, in order to spend the holiday with her two great-aunts near the village of Mickledean in Somersetshire, had looked forward to being in rural surroundings. She had dreamed of taking long walks in the crisp winter countryside, blue skies overhead, or else of wading to church and the Assembly Rooms through a soft white fall of snow.<br><br>But the wind and the cold devoid of sunshine had forced her to curtail the few walks she had undertaken, and the Assembly Rooms had remained firmly closed, everyone having been content, it seemed, to spend Christmas with family and friends this year rather than with all their neighbors at a communal party or ball.<br><br>Frances would have been lying to herself if she had not admitted to feeling just a little disappointment.<br><br>Miss Gertrude Driscoll and her widowed sister, Mrs. Martha Melford, Frances's great-aunts, who lived at the dower house in the park of Wimford Grange, had been invited to join Baron Clifton's family at the big house on Christmas Day, the baron being their great-nephew and therefore a cousin of some remove to Frances. Frances had been invited too, of course. They had also all been invited to a few other private parties in the neighborhood. But the great-aunts had sent back polite refusals to them all, declaring themselves too cozy in their own house to venture outdoors in such inclement weather and too contented with the coveted company of their great-niece to bother with any invitations. <br>They could, after all, visit their great-nephew and his family and their neighbors any day of the year. Besides, Great-Aunt Gertrude had fancied that she was coming down with something, though she had displayed no clearly discernible symptoms, and dared not stray too far from the fireside of her own home.<br><br>Frances's wishes had not been consulted.<br><br>Only when the holiday was over and they were hugging her and shedding a few tears over her and kissing her good-bye before she stepped up into their rather rickety private carriage, which they had insisted upon sending with her though it did not usually venture beyond a five-mile radius around the village, did it occur to her great-aunts that maybe they had been selfish in remaining at home all over the holiday and ought to have remembered that dear Frances was only three-and-twenty and would perhaps have enjoyed a party or two and the company of other young people to enliven the tedium of a Christmas spent entirely with two old ladies.<br><br>She had hugged them in return and shed a few tears of her own and assured them--almost truthfully--that they were all she had needed to make Christmas a wondrously happy occasion after a long term at school, though actually it had been more than one term. She had remained at the school all through last summer, since Miss Martin took in charity girls and it was always necessary to provide for their care and entertainment through the various holidays--and Frances had had nowhere particular to go at the time.<br><br>Christmas had, then, been a disappointingly dull holiday. But she really had enjoyed the quiet after the constantly busy bustle of school life. And she was extremely fond of her great-aunts, who had opened their arms and their hearts to her from the moment of her arrival in England as a motherless baby with a French emigre father who had been fleeing the Reign of Terror. She had no memory of that time, of course, but she knew that the aunts would have brought her into the country to live with them if Papa had chosen to let her go. But he had not. He had kept her with him in London, surrounding her with nurses and governesses and singing masters, and lavishing upon her all that money could buy for her comfort and pleasure--and oceans of love besides. She had had a happy, privileged, secure childhood and girlhood--until her father's sudden death when she was only eighteen.<br><br>But her aunts had had some role to play in her growing years. They had brought her into the country for holidays and had occasionally gone to London to take her about and buy her gifts and feed her ices and other treats. And ever since she had learned to read and write she had exchanged monthly letters with them. She was inordinately fond of them. It really had been lovely to spend Christmas in their company.<br><br>There had been no snow to enliven her Christmas, then.<br><br>There was snow, however--and plenty of it--soon after.<br><br>It began when the carriage was no more than eight or ten miles from Mickledean, and Frances did consider knocking on the roof panel and suggesting to the elderly coachman that they turn around and go back. But it was not a heavy snow, and she did not really want to delay her journey. It looked more like a white rain for all of the hour after it began. But inevitably--when it really was too late to turn back--the flakes became larger and thicker, and in an alarmingly short time the countryside, which had been looking as if it were rimed with heavy frost rather than with snow itself, began to disappear under a thickening blanket of white.<br><br>The carriage moved steadily onward, and Frances assured herself that it was foolish to be nervous, that the road was probably perfectly safe for travel, especially at the plodding speed to which Thomas was keeping the horses. Soon the snow would stop falling and begin to melt, as was always the way with snow in England.<br><br>She concentrated her thoughts on the term ahead, planning which pieces of music she would choose for the senior madrigal choir to sing. Something bright and brilliant and Elizabethan, she thought. She wondered if she dared choose something in five parts. The girls had mastered three-part singing and were doing rather well at four-part pieces, though they did sometimes break off in the middle of a phrase to collapse in laughter as they got hopelessly entangled in complex harmonies.<br><br>Frances smiled at the thought. She usually laughed with them. It was better--and ultimately more productive--than weeping.<br><br>Maybe they would try five parts.<br><br>Within another half hour, it was no longer possible to see anything but unrelieved white in any direction--and no longer possible to concentrate upon thoughts of school or anything else. And the snow was still falling so thickly that it dazzled the eyes and made it hard to see any great distance from the windows even if there had been anything to see. When she pressed the side of her face against the glass in order to look ahead, she could not even distinguish the road from the ditches or the fields beyond. And there did not even seem to be any hedgerows on this particular stretch that might have provided some sort of dark border to signify where the road was.<br><br>Panic clawed at her stomach.<br><br>Could Thomas see the road from his higher perch on the box? But the snow must be blowing into his eyes and half blinding him. And he must be twice as cold as she was. She pressed her hands deeper into the fur muff that Great-Aunt Martha had given her for Christmas. She would pay a fortune for a hot cup of tea, she thought.<br><br>So much for wishing for snow. What sage was it who had once said that one should beware of what one wished for lest the wish be granted?<br><br>She sat back in her seat, determined to trust Thomas to find the way. After all, he had been her great-aunts' coachman forever and ever, or at least for as far back as she could remember, and she had never heard of his being involved in any sort of accident. But she thought wistfully of the cozy dower house she had left behind and of the bustling school that was her destination. Claudia Martin would be expecting her today. Anne Jewell and Susanna Osbourne, the other resident teachers, would be watching for her arrival. They would all spend the evening together in Claudia's private sitting room, seated cozily about the fire, drinking tea and exchanging reminiscences of Christmas. <br>She would be able to give them a graphic account of the snowstorm through which she had traveled. She would embellish it and exaggerate the danger and her fears and have them all laughing.<br><br>But she was not laughing yet.<br><br>And suddenly laughter was as far from her thoughts as flying to the moon would be. The carriage slowed and rocked and slithered, and Frances jerked one hand free of her muff and grabbed for the worn leather strap above her head, convinced that they were about to tip right over at any moment. She waited to see her life flash before her eyes, and mumbled the opening words of the Lord's Prayer rather than scream and startle Thomas into losing the last vestiges of his control. The sound of the horses' hooves seemed deafening even though they were moving over snow and should have been silent. Thomas was shouting enough for ten men.<br><br>And then, looking out through the window nearest her rather than clench her eyes tightly shut and not even see the end approaching, she actually saw the horses, and instead of being up ahead pulling the carriage, they were drawing alongside her window and then forging ahead.<br><br>She gripped the strap even more tightly and leaned forward. Those were not her horses. Gracious heaven, someone was overtaking them--in these weather conditions.<br><br>The box of the overtaking carriage came into view with its coachman looking rather like a hunchbacked snowman bent over the ribbons and spewing hot abuse from his mouth--presumably at poor Thomas.<br><br>And then the carriage passed in a flash of blue, and Frances had the merest glimpse of a gentleman with many capes to his greatcoat and a tall beaver hat on his head. He looked back at her with one eyebrow cocked and an expression of supercilious contempt on his face.<br><br>He dared to be contemptuous of her?<br><br>Within moments the blue carriage was past, her own rocked and slithered some more, and then it appeared to right itself before continuing on its slow, plodding way.<br><br>Frances's fears were replaced by a hot fury. She seethed with it. Of all the reckless, inconsiderate, suicidal, homicidal, dangerous, stupid things to do! Goodness gracious, even if she pressed her nose to the window she could not see more than five yards distant, and the falling snow hampered vision even within that five yards. Yet that hunchbacked, foul-mouthed coachman and that contemptuous gentleman with his arrogant eyebrow were in such a hurry that they would endanger life and limb--her own and Thomas's as well as their own--in order to overtake?<br><br>But now that the excitement was over, she was suddenly aware again of being all alone in an ocean of whiteness. She felt panic contract her stomach muscles once more and sat back, deliberately letting go of the strap and folding her hands neatly inside her muff again. Panic would get her nowhere. It was altogether more probable that Thomas would get her somewhere.<br><br>Poor Thomas. He would be ready for something hot to drink--or more probably something strong and hot--when they arrived at that somewhere. He was by no means a young man.<br><br>With the fingers of her right hand she picked out the melody of a William Byrd madrigal on the back of her left hand, as if it were the keyboard of a pianoforte. She hummed the tune aloud.<br><br>And then she could feel the carriage rocking and slithering again and grasped for the strap once more. She looked out and ahead, not really expecting to see anything, but actually she could see a dark shape, which appeared to be blocking the way ahead. In one glimpse of near-clarity between snowflakes she saw that it was a carriage and horses. She even thought it might be a blue carriage.<br><br>But though the horses pulling her own had drawn to a halt, the carriage itself did not immediately follow suit. It swayed slightly to the left, righted itself, and then slithered more than slightly to the right--and this time it kept going until it reached what must have been the edge of the road, where one wheel caught on something. The conveyance performed a neat half-pirouette and slid gently backward and downward until its back wheels were nestled deep in a snowbank.<br><br>Frances, tipped backward and staring at the opposite seat, which was suddenly half above her, could see nothing but solid snow out of the windows on both sides.<br><br>And if this was not the outside of enough, she thought with ominous calm, then she did not know what was.<br><br>She was aware of a great clamor from somewhere--horses snorting and whinnying, men shouting.<br><br>Before she could collect herself sufficiently to extricate herself from her snowy cocoon, the door opened from the outside--not without some considerable assistance from male muscles and shocking male profanities--and an arm and hand clad in a thick and expensive greatcoat and a fine leather glove reached inside to assist her. It was obvious to her that the arm did not belong to Thomas. Neither did the face at the end of it--hazel-eyed, square-jawed, irritated, and frowning.<br><br>It was a face Frances had seen briefly less than ten minutes ago.<br><br>It was a face--and a person--against whom she had conceived a considerable hostility.<br><br>She slapped her hand onto his without a word, intending to use it to assist herself to alight with as much dignity as she could muster. But he hoisted her out from her awkward position as if she were a sack of meal and deposited her on the road, where her half-boots immediately sank out of sight beneath several inches of snow. She could feel all the ferocity of the cold wind and the full onslaught of the snow falling from the sky.<br><br>One was supposed to see red when one was furious. But she saw only white.<br><br>"You, sir," she said above the noise of the horses and of Thomas and the hunchbacked snowman exchanging vigorous and colorful abuse of each other, "deserve to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. You deserve to be flayed alive. You deserve to be boiled in oil."</p><h2>Pocket Dictionary of the Reformed Tradition (The IVP Pocket Reference Series)</h2><p>Beginning to study Reformed theology is like stepping into a family conversation that has been going on for five hundred years.

A vast stretch of fertile farmland bordering one of the largest concentrations of fresh water in the world, the Midwestern US seems ideally situated for the coming challenges of climate change. But it also sits at the epicenter of a massive economic collapse that many of its citizens are still struggling to overcome. The question of what the Midwest is (and what it will become) is nothing new. As Phil Christman writes in this idiosyncratic new book, ambiguity might be the region's defining characteristic. Taking a cue from Jefferson&#x2019;s grid, the famous rectangular survey of the Old Northwest Territory that turned everything from Ohio to Wisconsin into square-mile lots, Christman breaks his exploration of Midwestern identity, past and present, into 36 brief, interconnected essays. The result is a sometimes sardonic, often uproarious, and consistently thought-provoking look at a misunderstood place and the people who call it home.</p><p>A former substitute teacher, shelter worker, and home health aide, <b>Phil Christman</b> currently lectures in the English department at University of Michigan.

According to the now familiar story, mammal hunters entered the continent some 12,000 years ago via a land bridge that spanned the Bering Sea. Distinctive stone tools belonging to the Clovis culture established the presence of these early New World people. But are the Clovis tools Asian in origin? Drawing from original archaeological analysis, paleoclimatic research, and genetic studies, noted archaeologists Dennis J. Stanford and Bruce A. Bradley challenge the old narrative and, in the process, counter traditional&#x2015;and often subjective&#x2015;approaches to archaeological testing for historical relatedness. The authors apply rigorous scholarship to a hypothesis that places the technological antecedents of Clovis in Europe and posits that the first Americans crossed the Atlantic by boat and arrived earlier than previously thought. Supplying archaeological and oceanographic evidence to support this assertion, the book dismantles the old paradigm while persuasively linking Clovis technology with the culture of the Solutrean people who occupied France and Spain more than 20,000 years ago.</p><p>"<i>Across Atlantic Ice</i> is brilliant and ground-breaking.

Authors Valerie A. Kivelson and Ronald Grigor Suny examine how imperial practices shaped choices and limited alternatives. Using the concept of empire, they look at the ways in which ordinary people imagined their position within a non-democratic polity--whether the Muscovite tsardom or the Soviet Union--and what concessions the rulers had to make, or appear to make, in order to establish their authority and preserve their rule. <br><br><em>Russia's Empires</em> tackles the long history of the region, following the vicissitudes of empire--the absence, the coalescence, and the setbacks of imperial aspirations--across the centuries. The framework of empire allows the authors to address pressing questions of how various forms of non-democratic governance managed to succeed and survive, or, alternatively, what caused them to collapse and disappear. Studying Russia's extensive history in an imperial guise encourages students to pay attention to forms of inclusion, displays of reciprocity, and manifestations of ideology that might otherwise go unnoted, overlooked under the bleak record of coercion and oppression that so often characterizes ideas about Russia.<br></p><p><br><strong>Valerie A.

This should become the go-to text for college courses. An impressive achievement."--Willard Sunderland, <em>University of</em> <em>Cincinnati</em><p></p><br>"In this remarkable work, two of the leading historians of the 'imperial turn' have drawn on the past quarter-century of historical work and produced the most readable and insightful single volume of Russian history to date. Kivelson and Suny reveal how Russia's empires functioned as polities by employing not just coercive power but discursive power. In doing so, they illuminate how Russia also became an 'imperial nation,' one where national and imperial policies developed simultaneously yet frequently produced tensions. <em>Russia's Empires</em> is historical synthesis at its finest."--Stephen M. Norris, <em>Miami University</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Kivelson and Suny give us a concise and elegant new way to think about the development of Russia as an enormously complex multi-ethnic, multi-religious Eurasian empire over the course of its 1,000-year history."--Shoshana Keller, <em>Hamilton College</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Russia's Empires</em> provides an elegant, stimulating, and comprehensive account of Russian history, placing the management of imperial diversity at the heart of the narrative.

Norse, Dane, and English&#x2014;men who would normally face each other from behind the shieldwall&#x2014;sat beside each other on sea chests, shared deck space beneath the stars, and pulled the spruce oars together so that they beat like eagles&#x2019; wings, our bows slicing the sea. We even had a monk and a woman thrown in for good measure, though a monk aboard a longship is about as useful as a hole in a shield. Even so, Father Egfrith was a good man for all his fool&#x2019;s hope of sluicing the old gods from our black souls. As for the woman, she was Cynethryth, beautiful Cynethryth, and that was enough.<br><br>For seven weeks J�rmungand, Serpent&#x2019;s dragon prow, had forged into the unknown, following the Frankish coast. Then, after a long passage south, we had sailed the Dark Sea west, along the margin of a barren, rockbound land from which jagged, treeless, boulder-strewn mountains surged into the sky. That desolate shoreline was cut with rocky beaches, most of which were trapped by steep cliffs that plunged into the white-tossed breakers, and we had rarely made landfall for fear of tearing open our hulls.<br><br>Now we were plowing south again. On our steerboard side the black water stretched away to the west as far as the eye could see, and who knew what lay that way? But we were staying as close to land as we dared, for we had escaped the wrath of an empire and were lucky to still have the skins on our backs and the blood in our veins. Three other dragons followed in our wake: Sigurd&#x2019;s second ship, Fjord-Elk, and the two remaining Dane ships, sleek fast snekkjas named Wave-Steed and Sea-Arrow. We had escaped the Franks, and so we had escaped death, but in doing so we had lost our silver hoard, which had glittered and shone so brightly that perhaps the gods in Asgard had grown envious and decided to piss on our glory. I have learned that that is the gods&#x2019; way. They are capricious and cruel, inspiriting you to deeds worthy of a skald song and then knocking you onto your arse for all to see. Perhaps they have no love for us at all but merely watch the weave and weft of our small lives&#x2014;cutting or braiding a thread once in a while&#x2014;to help pass the great eternity of their own. The gods may not love us, but they do love chaos. And where there is chaos, there are warriors and swords, spears and shields. There is blood and pain and death.<br><br>And now we were sailing south to Miklagard, the Great City, because although we had lost our F�fnir&#x2019;s hoard, we were warriors still and they said that in Miklagard the buildings were made of gold. Besides which, we lusted for an even greater prize. I could see that hunger in men&#x2019;s eyes, reflected in the luster of their well-polished war gear: helms, shield bosses, and ax heads. That prize is fame. It is the meat of the skald&#x2019;s song, which men and women feast on around the hearth while the wind batters the hall door. It is the one prize that can never be lost or stolen or burned.<br><br>And we would find fame in Miklagard.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s no way to go,&#x201d; Penda said with a slight shake of his head. The sail was up and bellying, taking advantage of a decent following wind, and most of us had thrown furs around our shoulders because that wind had fingers of ice in it and we were not rowing. &#x201c;It must hurt like the Devil&#x2019;s own fire,&#x201d; the Wessexman muttered through a grimace.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no hope, then?&#x201d; I asked, knowing the answer but asking anyway.<br><br>&#x201c;There might have been,&#x201d; Penda said, &#x201c;if they&#x2019;d opened it up again and washed the muck away in time. Now . . . ?&#x201d; He shook his head again. &#x201c;Poor bastard&#x2019;s got a few days, perhaps. Hard days, too.&#x201d;<br><br>Halldor was standing at Serpent&#x2019;s prow, looking out rather than in, which I suspected was because he felt ashamed. A Frankish spear had sliced off half of his face, and although our godi, Asgot, had stitched it together, the wound rot had come, and now the Norseman&#x2019;s face was puffed up like a skin full of bad milk so that you couldn&#x2019;t even see his right eye. Reeking yellow pus oozed through the stitches, which seemed about to rip apart at any moment, and I could not imagine the pain of it. The previous day I had noticed a green tinge to the angry stretched skin. We all knew Halldor was a dead man.<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t wait much longer if it was me,&#x201d; Penda said, drawing his knife from its sheath and testing the edge against his thumbnail. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s always a length of rope and a rock,&#x201d; he suggested matter-of-factly, pointing his knife at Serpent&#x2019;s ballast.<br><br>&#x201c;And shiver in Hel until Ragnar�k?&#x201d; I shook my head. &#x201c;No Norseman would choose drowning,&#x201d; I said, shivering at the thought. For a drowned man there is no Valh�ll, just ice and the stiff black corpses of those who have died of old age or sickness. And there is a giant dog called Garm who will gnaw on your frozen bones to get to the marrow. &#x201c;Black Floki will do it,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;When the time comes.&#x201d; A whining gust whipped cold spray across the deck and hit the sail&#x2019;s leeward side, making it snap angrily.<br><br>&#x201c;Sooner rather than later, then,&#x201d; Penda gnarred, sheathing his blade with a satisfied nod. At sea you have to be careful not to oversharpen your blades for want of something to do.<br><br>&#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s gathering memories to take with him,&#x201d; I said, taking a lungful of the cold sea air that was ever sweetened by the pitch-soaked twisted horsehair stuffed between Serpent&#x2019;s strakes. &#x201c;Wherever he is going, he&#x2019;ll want to remember what it felt like to ride the whale&#x2019;s road,&#x201d; I said, watching Halldor put a mead skin to the grimace that was his mouth to dull the pain.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you finished your deep thinking yet, lad?&#x201d; Bram the Bear growled, galumphing over to Serpent&#x2019;s side, where he pulled down his breeks and began pissing over the sheer strake. &#x201c;I want to know how you&#x2019;re going to pay me what you owe, you son of a goat. And I&#x2019;m not the only one.&#x201d;<br><br>I sighed, knowing this was one matter that would keep coming back to me, like waves returning to the shore. For I had cast our silver adrift to tempt the Franks, and they had chosen to scoop up that treasure rather than pursue us, which was just as well because they had outnumbered us five to one and we were as exhausted as a Norseman in a nunnery.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s you who owes me, Bear,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;for saving that hairy hide of yours. It would be nailed to some Frank&#x2019;s door if not for me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pah!&#x201d; He batted my words away like gnats. &#x201c;It would take more than a few farting Franks to finish me, boy.&#x201d; Then he nodded toward Halldor and tugged his beard thoughtfully, his piss scattering downwind. &#x201c;If he&#x2019;d have kept his shield up . . . or his head down, he wouldn&#x2019;t be packing his sea chest for the dark journey.&#x201d; He shuddered, pulled up his breeks, and turned, pointing a thick finger at me. &#x201c;No, you owe me, Raven, and I don&#x2019;t like being silver-light.&#x201d; I saw that Penda was grinning, meaning that he was beginning to piece together scraps of Norse, which would save me having to translate everything for him.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you need silver for, Bear?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t drink silver. And I can&#x2019;t see many taverns around here to spend it in.&#x201d; I scratched my chin and frowned. &#x201c;I am wondering if you will even make it all the way to Miklagard, seeing as you are already older than the stars and the Great City is still far away.&#x201d; Some of the Norsemen chuckled at that, but Bram glowered at me like a man dragged from his death barrow.<br><br>&#x201c;Wind in that tongue of yours, whelp,&#x201d; he rumbled, &#x201c;or Bram&#x2019;ll trim it down to size for you.&#x201d; He patted the knife sheathed at his waist. &#x201c;Older than the stars? You mouthy runt! Hey, Svein, can you hear this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Raven has hit the rivet square, Bram,&#x201d; Svein said, studying his friend with a frown. &#x201c;You are looking old these days.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Son of a she troll!&#x201d; Bram rumbled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to shit in your beard when you&#x2019;re asleep tonight, Red,&#x201d; he threatened, at which Svein grinned. &#x201c;As for you, runt,&#x201d; he warned me, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll be lucky to reach next summer if you don&#x2019;t learn to respect your betters.&#x201d; His beard bristled in the gathering wind. &#x201c;Just remember the silver you owe us, Raven,&#x201d; he called out, stirring a few &#x201c;aye&#x201d;s and disgruntled murmurs, his eyes glinting. &#x201c;No man likes to be silver-light.&#x201d; Even Svein nodded agreement with that.<br><br>And I sighed again.<br><br>But before long we were poking fun at Yrsa Pig-Nose for the great red boil that had bloomed on the side of his snout, and after Yrsa it was the Wessexman Baldred&#x2019;s turn to endure a good tongue-lashing because he had the shits and had grabbed the nearest bucket, which had happened to be one of our freshwater pails.<br><br>We were chaffing because we were nervous. Even I had been at sea long enough to smell a storm in the air, and this one was coming our way, its fingers already grasping at us. I had seen it first as swaths of dark rippling water contrasting against a lighter blue where current and wind fought over the direction in which the waves should move. Then the wind had whipped flecks of spume from those waves, and Serpent&#x2019;s bowline had begun to swing and the reefing ropes began beating the sail. Now we were talking too much, trying to make out that it was nothing more than a sniff of a breeze that would sputter itself out before long, when the truth was we were afraid. I think the only man aboard who was not afraid was Halldor, because he was already a dead man, but then again, not even Halldor wanted a drowning death.</p><h2>Powers of Darkness: Principalities Powers in Paul&#39;s Letters</h2><p>Satan worship.

But they haven&#x2019;t always felt this way. For the ancient Greeks, happiness meant virtue. For the Romans, it implied prosperity and divine favor. For Christians, happiness was synonymous with God. Throughout history, happiness has been equated regularly with the highest human calling, the most perfect human state. Yet it&#x2019;s only within the past two hundred years that human beings have begun to think of happiness as not just an earthly possibility but also as an earthly entitlement, even an obligation. In this sweeping new book, historian Darrin M. McMahon argues that our modern belief in happiness is the product of a dramatic revolution in human expectations carried out since the eighteenth century.<br>In the tradition of works by Peter Gay and Simon Schama, <i>Happiness</i> draws on a multitude of sources, including art and architecture, poetry and scripture, music and theology, and literature and myth, to offer a sweeping intellectual history of man&#x2019;s most elusive yet coveted goal.</p><p>Even when the subject is, alluringly, happiness, readers may fear that a 544-page, heavily annotated book will be a dry, abstruse tome. Be not afraid. Erudite and detailed without being pedantic, Happiness is lively, lucid and enjoyable. Darrin M. McMahon's history of happiness concentrates on the great books of the Western world. From ancient Greek tragedies' portrayal of happiness as a gift of the gods, through Roman celebrations of everyday comforts and pleasures, the medieval Christian focus on eternal bliss, and the modern conviction that earthly happiness is not just a right but practically a duty, McMahon traces the way conceptions of happiness have changed. The author, a professor of history at Florida State University, demonstrates "not only the centrality of the issue of happiness to the Western tradition, but the centrality of that same tradition and legacy to contemporary concerns." His book abounds with intriguing material. For example, it shows how G.K. Chesterton's aphorism "The world is full of Christian ideas gone mad" applies to happiness: Just as Christianity promises heaven, various secular thinkers came to promise heaven on earth -- earthly happiness -- to those who followed the true path. Conversely, McMahon points out that "the church could scarcely fail to present [its eternal] reward in terms that appealed directly to the senses. Beatitude would satisfy our hunger, quench our thirst, gratify all our longings." In the theology of St. Thomas Aquinas, in heaven "the saved will literally be drunk on God." Some Christian mystics even described divine rapture in such "frankly erotic terms" as "the cleaving to the breast of Mary and the taking in of her warm milk." Readers may be tempted to conclude that Christianity is full of worldly ideas gone mad. Also noteworthy is McMahon's observation that traditionally, "a life of privilege was a life without labor ....That men and women should come to believe -- even to expect -- that work ... should sustain their happiness, serving as a source of satisfaction in its own right, is therefore a recent and quite remarkable development." McMahon displays his gift for nimble commentary by adding that it is "one of the delicious ironies of history" that "Marx's contention that not only should we enjoy the fruits of our labor, but labor itself should be our fruit, is today a central tenet of the capitalist creed." Another particularly delightful exhibition of this knack is his reference to the bourgeoisie as "that amorphous group against whom Romantics and revolutionaries alike constantly railed, even as they freely accepted their funds." The book is further enriched by numerous well-chosen illustrations, including an amusing photograph of an adornment of a bakery in Pompeii. The photograph shows the image of a penis, accompanied by the words "Hic Habitat Felicitas" -- here dwells happiness. McMahon's discussion is generally excellent, sympathetic without being uncritical, but occasionally he falters. When considering Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, he criticizes our own society for resembling Huxley's fictional one in that people are "encouraged wherever possible to eradicate the unpleasant rather 'than learning to put up with it.'" But our society has diverse voices, so many of which discourage hedonism that McMahon's criticism is rather hackneyed. In his account of Romanticism, he calls it "a truth" that "suffering [is] necessary to educate the self, to make us more complete human beings." So it is hardly surprising that he accepts Huxley's supposition that in a society where everything is pleasurable, life is bound to revolve around superficial sensory thrills, mindless entertainment and material consumption. This debatable supposition cries out for the balanced and nuanced treatment McMahon gives most of the ideas he discusses. The same point applies to McMahon's uncritical endorsement of the outlook of University of Chicago ethicist Leon R. Kass, the former chair of the Bush administration's Council on Bioethics. This endorsement ignores the reasons why Kass's conservative views are objectionable to many. McMahon maintains that "there is a critical difference between aiming to alleviate senseless suffering and striving to overcome [what Freud called] 'ordinary unhappiness.'" Senseless suffering should be assuaged, he argues, but ordinary unhappiness should be accepted as "inherent to being human." Accordingly, he echoes Kass's antipathy to using medical science " 'beyond therapy' -- beyond, that is, 'the usual domain of medicine and the goals of healing'" to overcome ordinary unhappiness. But McMahon's own recognition that "there is, and can be ... no objective standard of what it is to feel normal, to experience a 'typical' human balance between pleasure and pain" calls the distinction between "senseless suffering" and "ordinary happiness" into question. Furthermore, McMahon's clich�d claim that humans who would manipulate "our genes to enhance our happiness" would "be leaving a piece of their humanity behind" should be assessed in light of a recent suggestion by technology pioneer Ray Kurzweil: The essence of being human lies not in our limitations but in our ability to transcend them. Again, a much more balanced treatment is needed. Fortunately, the book's strengths far outweigh its flaws. Although McMahon neither promises nor delivers the secret of happiness, his book can bring readers the satisfaction of intellectual adventure.

All Rights Reserved.Before the contemporary onslaught of therapeutic treatments and self-help guidance, the very idea of happiness in this life was virtually unknown. In this eminently readable work, McMahon (<i>Enemies of Enlightenment</i>) looks back through 2,000 years of thought, searching for evidence of how our contemporary obsession came to be. From the tragic plays of ancient Greece to the inflammatory rhetoric of Rousseau and Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence, McMahon delves deeply into the rich trove of texts that elucidate and confirm the development of Western notions of this elusive ideal. In one particularly rousing section, he highlights the breakthrough thinking of German theologian and religious revolutionary Martin Luther. Locked in self-imposed exile in the Augustine Black Monastery in Wittenberg, Luther struggled with a God who punished sinners, then realized that man is "justified&#x2014;made just, not punished with justice..." and that this life was one to be lived, that man must "drink more, engage in sports and recreation, aye, even sin a little" in order to be happy. Throughout McMahon leads the reader with strong, clear thinking, laying out his ideas with grace, both challenging and entertaining us in equal measure. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

God taught him how to have abundance in the area of finances. Andrew discusses the influence of money in our lives and how it is very real. He teaches that Jesus taught more about managing resources than He did on prayer or even faith. He exposes the manipulation that sometimes goes on with Christian ministers and how you can be immune from it. Andrew Wommack&#39;s message is clear that even though there are abuses in the body of Christ regarding money, that you can still benefit from the truths in God s Word about finances. He believes that by fixing your heart that you deal with the root cause of financial situations and then money will take care of itself. Once your heart is right, using wisdom in how you spend your money comes naturally.</p><p>For over three decades Andrew Wommack has traveled America and the world teaching the truth of the gospel. His profound revelation of the Word of God is taught with clarity and simplicity, emphasizing God&#39;s unconditional love and the balance between grace and faith. He reaches millions of people through the daily Gospel Truth radio and television programs, broadcast both domestically and internationally. Gospel Truth television broadcast can be seen on INSP, DayStar, The Church Channel, Cornerstone, Guardian, God TV, and over 80 local US channels. Gospel Truth radio broadcast is heard on more than 60 stations nationwide.

She is spunky, sensitive, and not nearly as pious as her older sister Emma. Lizzie sometimes daydreams instead of praying when she bows her head before meals . . . but she figures God knows she&#x2019;s grateful for the good food Mam puts on the table every night. Her wild spirit often gets her in trouble, though, and she wonders why she can&#x2019;t be as sweet and kind as her goody-two-shoes big sister. Will she always be at odds with her own fiery spirit?<br> Although Lizzie loves adventure, when her father&#x2019;s business begins to struggle and she learns they&#x2019;re moving to a new house in a different town, all she wants is to stay in the beloved home she knows with the little picket fence, the bubbling creek, and her favorite climbing trees. Through Linda Byler&#x2019;s vivid descriptions of Amish life, you can walk with Lizzie as she adjusts to a new school, experience the terror of their awful buggy accident, laugh at her misadventures, and feel her struggle as she begins to question who she is as an individual in the midst of her tight knit Amish community.<br> This is the first book in the Buggy Spoke series, which follows Lizzie through her tumultuous teenage years as she struggles to mesh her hot temper and willful ways with her Amish faith. These books are the prequels to Linda Byler&#x2019;s bestselling Lizzie Searches for Love Trilogy, geared to a younger audience (ages 8-10). Reminiscent of Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x2019;s Little House series, these books are delightful accounts of another way of life; each chapter is filled with vivid descriptions of Amish food, farms, and traditions.

In its pages are over 125 spells, incantations, and charms. If you can think of a purpose for a spell, it's probably in this book. Need a spell to summon a ghost? Or perhaps you want the opposite: a spell to free a house from being haunted. They're both in this book. Do you need something to help you lose weight or have longevity? You'll find them here. Or perhaps you want to pass through a locked door. It's all in this book.</p> <p>Even if you don't know a thing about magic, you can use this book. The spells are easy, poetic, and evocative. For example, to cure a wart the instructions are: "Stamp within a silver cup mullein and houseleek together. Stir them with a sparrow's feather. Let it draw the juices up; Twenty times upon one day, brush them over the excrescence; Under sunlight dry the essence&#x2015;Soon the wart must shrink away."</p> <p>The range in this book is phenomenal. You'll find a simple fertility charm and a way to conjure with smoke. You'll read about how to bring rain and how to stop rain from falling. You'll learn how to tell fortunes with sand or with tea leaves. This is more than just a book about magic, it is a folklorist's bonanza.</p> <p>If you're ready to win another's love or to sweeten someone's disposition, if you want to turn hair long and golden or discover tree spirits, this is the book you must have. Whether you have been doing magic for a long time or are a beginner, this book is a must. <br> </p></p><p>Sometimes I want to study subjects in depth. At other times, especially when it comes to magic, I often just want the basics so I can get things done. That's the concept behind Valerie Worth's <i>Crone's Book of Magical Words </i>(previously published as <i>The Crone's Book of Words). <br></i>This book is simply filled with spells and charms, rituals, and techniques that will help bring magic into your life. There are over 125 of them, and you're going to find you will be able to use many of them right away. <br>There are spells for your home and spells for your attitude, spells for health and spells to call ghosts, spells for divination and spells for invisibility. Do you need to know how to become invisible? You'll find out in this book. <br>In many traditions of Paganism, spells should be done in rhyme. In this book the spells and instructions are in rhyme. As you read over instructions for such things as how to treat a leaking house, or a spell for riches, you'll see how poetry can be found everywhere. This means you'll be better able to design your own rhyming rituals and poetic empowerment. <br>Sometimes, simplicity equals elegance and power. That is the case here. The complete yet brief rites and charms will have you spinning a web of magic in no time. <br>This book is not only a great tool for people starting on a magical path, it is also ideal for people who are on the path and who want to expand their possibilities. If you fit into either of these categories, this book is a must. <br> <br>Here is magic to enjoy and magic to use -- 128 incantations, instructions, and spells. This is magic from the heart. It sings in a woman&#39;s voice, and is shaped with a woman&#39;s hands; it is the magic incarnate in every woman who knows of the power within.</p><h2>Washington&#39;s Best Fishing Waters</h2><p>Washington&#39;s Best Fishing Waters features 159 detailed fishing maps of 38 of Washington s best rivers and streams.

Now, he is an exile. Arriving in Dayan, the last Chinese town before the Tibetan border, he is surprised to find it teeming with travelers, soldiers, and merchants. All have come for a spectacle unprecedented in this remote province: an eclipse of the sun commanded by the Emperor himself.</p><p>When a Jesuit astronomer is found murdered in the home of the local magistrate, blame is hastily placed on Tibetan bandits. But Li Du suspects this was no random killing. Everyone has secrets: the ambitious magistrate, the powerful consort, the bitter servant, the irreproachable secretary, the East India Company merchant, the nervous missionary, and the traveling storyteller who can't keep his own story straight.</p><p>Beyond the sloping roofs and festival banners, Li Du can see the mountain pass that will take him out of China forever. He must choose whether to leave and embrace his exile, or to stay and investigate a murder that the town of Dayan seems all too willing to forget.</p></p><p>ELSA HART was born in Rome, Italy, but her earliest memories are of Moscow, where her family lived until 1991.

In fourteen engaging, beautifully written chapters, Wolosky explores in depth how poetry does what it does while offering brilliant readings of some of the finest lyric poetry in the English and American traditions. Both readers new to poetry and poetry veterans will be moved and enlightened as Wolosky interprets work by William Shakespeare, John Donne, William Blake, William Wordsworth, Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost, Sylvia Plath, and others. The book includes a superb two-chapter discussion of the sonnet's form and history, and represents the first poetry guide to introduce gender as a basic element of analysis.<br><br>In contrast to many existing guides, which focus on selected formal aspects like metrics or present definitions and examples in a handbook format, <em>The Art of Poetry</em> covers the full landscape of poetry's subtle art while showing readers how to comprehend a poetic text in all its dimensions. Other special features include Wolosky's consideration of historical background for the developments she discusses, and the way her book is designed to acquaint or reacquaint readers with the core of the lyric tradition in English.<br><br>Lively, accessible, and original, <em>The Art of Poetry</em> will be a rich source of inspiration for students, general readers, and those who teach poetry.<br></p><p><br><strong>Shira Wolosky</strong> is Professor of English and American Literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.<br><br>"The project itself is both coherent and concise, relying on close readings of short, post-medieval poems...to introduce concepts of diction, syntax, metre, and rhyme. At its best, the book shows that clarity of discussion need not sell short depth of analysis, or complexity of awareness, and it is an excellent starting-point for any serious consideration of form in poetry, of what poetry does to language and what language is always ready to do to poetry."--Peter McDonald, <em>Poetry Review</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Art of Poetry</em> is both a superb technical manual and an authentic guide to the art of reading poetry. With brilliance and extraordinary lucidity, Wolosky illuminates such essential matters as metaphor, poetic voice, and the crucial relation of rhetoric to poetic meaning. I cannot imagine a more useful and distinguished book of this kind." --Harold Bloom, Yale University<p></p><br>"Wolosky has written the best basic treatment I know of the art of poetry. Wolosky structures the book brilliantly, and makes the process of learning about textual virtuosity and semantic complexity a joy. She builds her explications from the ground up (or from the surface down), always with attention to what it means to make a student get into a poem step by step. I have learned a great deal from this work, though I've been teaching poetry for twenty years. This is a genuinely important book, and I predict it will become in short time a standard text for teaching poetry."--Sacvan Bercovitch, Harvard University<p></p><br>"Here is a generous <em>Art of Poetry</em> for the modern English-speaking world. How tellingly Shira Wolosky moves from matters of taxonomy to those of technique, from the rudiments of poetic form to the resonance of poetic voice and point of view--from praxis to theory and back, from literary history to the experience of the literature itself. For at every step the author supports her claims with readings of individuals poems that are close and adept, eloquent and acute. This book is a welcome gift, an arresting vade mecum for student and teacher, reader and writer alike."--Robert Fagles, Princeton University<p></p><br>"Shira Wolosky's comprehensive and lucid practical introduction to what makes poems poetic also provides a sophisticated and informative look at theoretical poetics in all its aspects. Its annotated bibliography alone will give interested readers of all sorts a good sense of what scholars, critics, and linguists have had to say about poetry during the twentieth century. It is rare that an elementary study can also be as useful for advanced students and teachers of poetry as this well-worked-out exposition, clearly written and free of pseudotheoretical jargon."-- John Hollander, Yale University<p></p><br></p><h2>Dictatorship</h2><p>Now available in English for the first time, <i>Dictatorship</i> is Carl Schmitt&#x2019;s most scholarly book and arguably a paradigm for his entire work. <br> <br> Written shortly after the Russian Revolution and the First World War, Schmitt analyses the problem of the state of emergency and the power of the Reichspr�sident in declaring it. Dictatorship, Schmitt argues, is a necessary legal institution in constitutional law and has been wrongly portrayed as just the arbitrary rule of a so-called dictator. <br> <br> <i>Dictatorship</i> is an essential book for understanding the work of Carl Schmitt and a major contribution to the modern theory of a democratic, constitutional state. And despite being written in the early part of the twentieth century, it speaks with remarkable prescience to our contemporary political concerns.</p><p><b>Carl Schmitt</b> (1888-1985) is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important and influential political theorists of the twentieth century."At last Carl Schmitt's <i>Dictatorship</i> is available in English. His study and analysis of this concept is key to understanding the varieties of dictatorship."<br> <b>&#x2015;George Schwab, National Committee on American Foreign Policy<br> <br> </b>"<i>Dictatorship</i> is the first book ever entirely devoted to the topic of emergency powers. Written as Germany's fledgeling Weimar Republic resorted to emergency measures to confront insurrections from both the Left and the Right, Schmitt explored the historical origins and philosophical justifications of extraordinary executive action. Schmitt's <i>Dictatorship</i> is a fascinating historical document and a prescient, insightful resource for contemporary debates in political theory and constitutional law."<br> <b>&#x2015;John P.

And the break-ins at 204 Rosewood Lane, the house Faith just happens to be renting from Grace Harding....&nbsp;<br><br>All of that's a distraction from what's happening in my life. I'm going through chemo right now, and I'm so grateful for my husband, Jack, my family and my friends, who give me the strength and support I need to beat this. But beat it I will!&nbsp;<br><br>I'd suggest meeting at Troy's place, 92 Pacific Boulevard, so we can all talk, but the Pancake Palace is probably a better choice if you want a decent cup of coffee!&nbsp;<br><br>Olivia</p><p>Debbie Macomber is a #1 New York Times bestselling author and a leading voice in women&#x2019;s fiction worldwide.

For more information, visit her website, www.debbiemacomber.com.Troy Davis had been with the sheriff's department in Cedar Cove for most of his working life. He knew this town and he knew these people; he was one of them. Four times now he'd been elected to the office of sheriff by an overwhelming majority.<br><br>Sitting at his desk on this bleak January day, he let his mind wander as he sipped stale coffee. The department stuff was never good, no matter how recently it'd been brewed. As he sat there, he thought about Sandy, his wife of more than thirty years. She'd died last year of complications related to MS. Her death had left a gaping hole in his life. He'd often discussed his cases with her and had come to appreciate her insights. She usually had opinions, carefully considered ones, on what led people to commit the crimes that brought them to his attention.<br><br>Troy would've been interested in her views on one of his current cases. A couple of local teenagers had come upon skeletal remains in a cave not far from the road leading out of town. Partial results of the autopsy were finally in, but they raised more questions than they answered. Additional tests were forthcoming, and they might provide further information. He could only hope.... Hard though it was to believe, the body had gone all this time without discovery, and no one seemed to know who it was.<br><br>Despite this perplexing&#x2014;and very cold&#x2014;case and, of course, the loss of his wife, Troy had reason to count his blessings. He had a comfortable life, good friends and his only child, Megan, was married to a fine young man. In fact, Troy couldn't have chosen a better husband for his daughter had he handpicked Craig himself. In a few months, Megan would give birth to his first grandchild.<br><br>As far as finances went, Troy had no complaints. His house was paid off and so was his car. He enjoyed his work and had strong ties to the community.<br><br>And yet... he was miserable.<br><br>That misery could be attributed to one source.<br><br>Faith Beckwith.<br><br>Troy had reconnected with his high-school girlfriend, and almost before he realized what was happening, he'd fallen in love with her all over again.<br><br>Neither of them possessed an impulsive personality. They were adults; they'd known what they wanted and what they were doing.<br><br>Then the relationship that had seemed so promising had come to a sudden end&#x2014;thanks to his daughter's reaction and to some undeniably bad judgment on Troy's part.<br><br>When Megan learned he was dating again so soon after her mother's death, she'd been very upset. Troy understood his daughter's feelings. It <i>had </i>only been a few months since they'd buried Sandy; however, Sandy had been ill for years, and in some ways, their farewells had been said long before. But the fact that Troy had hidden his relationship with Faith from his daughter had contributed significantly to the whole mess.<br><br>On the evening of Troy's first visit to Faith's home in Seattle, the first time he'd kissed her, Megan had been at the hospital. She'd had a miscarriage. And while she and Craig were at the hospital, they couldn't reach Troy&#x2014; because he'd turned off his cell phone. Because he hadn't wanted his hours with Faith interrupted.<br><br>His guilt had been overwhelming. The baby had meant everything to Megan and Craig, especially so soon after Sandy's death.<br><br>In retrospect Troy saw that he'd completely mishandled the situation. Immediately after Megan's miscarriage he'd broken off the relationship with Faith. He'd acted out of remorse but he hadn't taken Faith's feelings into account; her shock and pain haunted him to this day.<br><br>He'd dedicated himself to his daughter and her needs ever since. That didn't mean he'd stopped thinking about Faith&#x2014;far from it. Thoughts of her filled his every waking moment.<br><br>To complicate this already complicated situation, Faith had sold her Seattle home and moved to Cedar Cove to be closer to her son, Scott&#x2014;and to Troy. Seeing her around town these days was torture. Faith had made it clear that she wanted nothing to do with him. Troy didn't blame her.<br><br>"I have that missing-persons file for you, Sheriff." Cody Woodchase stepped into his office and set the folder in Troy's in-basket.<br><br>"Thanks," Troy murmured. "You checked the appropriate dates?"<br><br>Cody nodded, dutifully efficient. "And came up blank. The only major case I can personally recall was Daniel Sherman a few years back."<br><br>Troy was well aware of the outcome. His old highschool friend had walked away from his family for no apparent reason. He'd simply vanished. The case had bothered Troy for well over a year. As it turned out, Dan had committed suicide, his body eventually found in the woods.<br><br>"That one was solved," Troy pointed out.<br><br>"I remember," Cody said. "Anyway, I pulled all the pertinent missing-persons files and printed them out for you."<br><br>"Thanks." Troy reached for the folder as soon as Cody left his office. Cedar Cove was fortunate enough to have a low crime rate. Oh, there was the occasional public disturbance, domestic violence now and then, a break-in, a drunk driver&#x2014;the sort of crime common to any small town. There was a mystery every once in a while, too. The biggest that came to mind was the man who'd shown up at Thyme and Tide, the Beldons' B and B. The stranger had the misfortune to die that very night. But that case, which was actually a murder, had been solved, too.<br><br>And now...the human remains, found just before Christmas.<br><br>According to the autopsy, they were those of a young man. A teenage boy between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. Based on those bones, there was no obvious cause of death. No blunt-force trauma, for instance. He'd been dead as long as twenty-five to thirty years.<br><br>Twenty-five to thirty years!<br><br>Troy had been with the department back then, untested and eager to prove himself. Sandy was pregnant after miscarrying twice, optimistic that this time they'd have their baby.<br><br>If a missing teenager had been reported in the late '70s or early '80s, Troy was confident he would've remembered it. The files Cody had printed out indicated that he was right. Not a single case involving a missing teenager, male or female, had been left unresolved.<br><br>To be on the safe side, he checked five years before and five years after. Twelve boys, mostly runaways, had been reported missing in that time. They'd all been found, either returning of their own accord or located by friends, relatives or the authorities.<br><br>Surely this young man had family, a mother and father, who must have wondered and waited in anguish. Troy closed his eyes and tried to think of boys he'd known during that time. Random names and faces rushed through his mind.<br><br>Around 1985, he recalled, Cedar Cove High School had won the state baseball championship. He could picture the first baseman, Robbie something, and Weaver, one of his deputies now, who'd been the team's star pitcher. Troy had attended all the play-off games. Sandy had gone with him and, although she wasn't a real baseball fan, she'd clapped and yelled her heart out.<br><br>Oh, how he missed Sandy....<br><br>Troy had visited her grave a couple of times over the holidays. Even at the end, when her body had failed her and MS had stolen much of her dignity, she'd been cheerful. He missed her appreciation of life's simple joys.<br><br>At least he and Megan were over <i>the firsts</i>&#x2014;the first Thanksgiving without Sandy. The first Christmas. The first birthday, wedding anniversary and Mother's Day... Those were the big ones, when her loss felt like a burden that would never grow lighter. When he and his daughter both acknowledged that nothing would ever be the same.<br><br>Troy was startled out of his reverie by someone calling his name.<br><br>"Am I interrupting anything important?" Louie Benson asked, standing in the office doorway.<br><br>"Louie." Troy rose to his feet. It wasn't every day he received a visit from the mayor of Cedar Cove. "Come on in. Good to see you." He gestured toward the chair in front of his desk.<br><br>"Happy New Year," Louie said as he slid into the seat. He rested one ankle on the opposite knee, striking a relaxed pose.<br><br>"Same to you," Troy said and sat back down. "What can I do for you?" The mayor was a busy man and didn't waste time on unnecessary visits. The fact was, Troy couldn't remember when Louie had last sought him out. Oh, they ran into each other often enough; that was unavoidable, since they worked in the same office complex. Socially they were acquaintances and he saw Louie at civic functions or the occasional party.<br><br>Louie's expression grew serious, and he leaned forward. "I've got a couple of things I want to discuss with you."<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>Louie looked down at the floor. "First, I want to remind you that I'm up for reelection this November. I was hoping for an endorsement."<br><br>"It's yours." Troy was surprised the other man felt the need to bring it up so early in the year. Besides, he'd supported Louie's previous campaigns. Nothing had changed. To the best of his knowledge, no other candidates had declared their intentions to run against him.<br><br>"I value your support," Louie said. "And of course you have mine." His gaze fell on Troy's desk. "On another matter... What can you tell me about those remains that were recently discovered?"<br><br>"I got the autopsy report a few days ago," Troy told him. "Jack Griffin ran an article about it in the <i>Chronicle </i>over the weekend. I'd hoped someone might step forward with information as a result. Dental evidence is useless because without a name we can't get a chart for comparison. To date, I have nothing."<br><br>Louie leaned back in his chair and eyed the open folder on Troy's desk. "So...no clue who that unfortunate soul might be?"<br><br>"None whatsoever."<br><br>This didn't appear to please the mayor. "The reason I'm pushing you on this is that I got a call from the Seattle paper. Apparently Jack's story aroused some interest there. They want to do a piece on those unidentified remains." The mayor's frown deepened. "I tried to steer the reporter away from the subject, but she seems determined to find out whatever she can. I gave her your contact information, so expect a call."<br><br>"Must be a slow news day." Troy appreciated getting advance notice. "Thanks for the heads-up." Over the years he'd dealt with the press many times and was accustomed to handling reporters. He had nothing against them as long as they didn't probe where they didn't belong or print misinformation.<br><br>"My fear," Louie went on to explain, "is that a negative story will hurt Cedar Cove's reputation. We want to attract tourists, not drive them away with... with ghoulish stories about our town."<br><br>"At this point there's nothing for them to report," Troy reassured him.<br><br>"Have you found out <i>anything?" </i>Louie inquired.<br><br>"Not really." Troy shrugged. "Pretty much what Jack wrote in that article. The remains are those of a male, between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. He's been dead since 1980, give or take a few years. No indication how he died."<br><br>Louie seemed uninterested in the details. "The thing is, Cedar Cove doesn't need any bad press. Our initiative this year is to attract more tourists to the area. I hate the thought of Cedar Cove becoming the center of some macabre story about unidentified remains and an unsolved mystery."<br><br>Troy nodded. "Yeah, I hear you."<br><br>"Good." Louie rose to his feet. "Do your best to solve this as quickly as possible."<br><br>Standing up, too, Troy opened his mouth to assure the mayor he was doing the best he could, but he wasn't given the opportunity.<br><br>"I'm not saying I want you to sweep anything under the rug, you understand?" the mayor said.<br><br>"Of course I won't."<br><br>"Good." Louie extended his hand and Troy shook it. "Make sure nothing sensational or misleading gets printed, okay? Like I said, I want Cedar Cove to become a tourist destination, not some freak sideshow."<br><br>"Do you remember the reporter's name?" Troy asked.<br><br>"I doubt I'd forget it. Kathleen Sadler."<br><br>"Kathleen Sadler," Troy repeated. "Not to worry, I'll set her straight."<br><br>"Thanks." Louie gave him a relieved smile. "I knew I could count on you."<br><br>When the mayor had left, Troy went back to the paperwork on his desk. The phone rang frequently that afternoon, but there was no call from the reporter. He just hoped Kathleen Sadler hadn't taken it upon herself to investigate the actual location. The cave was still taped off, but a piece of yellow crime-scene tape wasn't always a deterrent to determined reporters.<br><br>Troy had kept the names of the two teenagers who'd discovered the body out of the <i>Chronicle. </i>However, that didn't mean Sadler wouldn't be able to track them down.<br><br>After they'd stumbled upon the remains, Troy had spoken to the teens twice. He was confident Philip "Shaw" Wilson and Tannith Bliss had told him everything they knew, which wasn't much. The conversations had been straightforward. Although Tannith&#x2014; Tanni&#x2014;had done a good job of pretending to shrug off the incident, Troy could tell she'd been badly shaken. He was glad to turn the sixteen-year-old over to her mother.<br><br>The last thing Tanni needed was to be questioned by the Seattle press. Shaw was a bit older and Troy felt the young man would cope admirably with a barrage of questions. It might not hurt to give the two of them some warning.<br><br>His phone rang and Troy grabbed it, prepared to talk to the elusive Kathleen Sadler. "Sheriff Davis."<br><br>"Uh, I hope I'm not disturbing you unnecessarily." It was Cody Woodchase.<br><br>Troy caught the hesitation in his voice. "You're not. What's up?"<br><br>"I just got a call from the 9-1-1 dispatcher and apparently there's been a break-and-enter at 204 Rosewood Lane."<br><br>"Faith?" Troy's reaction was immediate as he bolted to his feet. That was the address of the rental house where Faith had recently moved. She'd been there a little more than two months.<br><br>"I believe I heard she might be a... friend of yours."<br><br>"Yes," Troy said curtly, his throat muscles tight.<br><br>"I thought you'd want to know."<br><br>"I do, Cody. Thank you." Within seconds, Troy had thrown on his coat and reached for his hat. He charged out the office door, unable to think of anything but Faith. He needed to know she hadn't been hurt, that she was safe from harm.</p><h2>Polar Shift (The NUMA Files)</h2><p><b>NUMA operative Kurt Austin takes on a madman fronting as an evironmentalist in this #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>-bestselling series.</b><br><br>Sixty years ago, an eccentric Hungarian genius discovered how to artificially trigger such a shift in the polar ice caps, which could cause massive eruptions, earthquaks, and even climate changes.

She lives in Virginia.Affluence, Dread, <br>and the Discovery of <br>Poverty<br><p>The "discovery" of poverty at the beginning of the 1960s was something like the "discovery" of America almost five hundred years earlier. In the case of each of these exotic terrains, plenty of people were on the site before the discoverers ever arrived. The fact that they had to be found reveals less about them than it does about the delusions that guided their discoverers. Columbus's discovery, for example, tells us something about the vantage point of fifteenth-century Europeans: Believing that the world was small and conveniently arranged for commerce in spice and gold, they misjudged the size of the earth by at least two continents and an ocean.</p><p>So, too, the discovery of poverty tells us something about the peculiarly limited vision of middle-class Americans at the middle of the twentieth century. Living in what they took to be the final stage of material affluence--defined by cars, television, and backyard barbecue pits-they believed that this was America. Looking out through their picture windows, they saw only an endless suburb, with no horizon, no frontier, in sight. They believed, almost, that America had stepped outside of history, and that the only changes to come would be the Predictable improvements brought by technological progress: automation, space travel, a cure for cancer, more fidelitous hifi equipment.</p><p>From this vantage point the jagged edges of inequality seemed to have disappeared, smoothed out by the affluence that had come to encase American society like middle-aged girth. There were no distinct social classes-only one vast middle class with no known boundaries. As Vance Packard, one of the few dissenters from the dogma of American classlessness, wryly reported in 1959:</p><p>A number of influential voices have been advising us that whatever social classes we ever had are now indeed withering away . . . Some months ago, a national periodical proclaimed that the United States had recently achieved the 11 most truly classless society in history." A few weeks later, a publisher hailed the disappearance of the class system as "the biggest news of our era."</p><p>Unfortunately, even Packard quickly turned from class, with its implications of persistent injustice, to the more entertaining subject of status-as expressed, for example, by one's sofa:</p><p>The lower-class people preferred a sofa with tassels hanging from the arms and fringe around the bottom. The high-status people preferred a sofa with simple, severe, right-angled lines.</p><p>Yet, despite the intricate hierarchy of tastes documented by Packard and others, there was a general sense that America had finally been homogenized into a level mass. Blue-collar workers were reported to be buying houses in Levittown and sending their children to college; union leaders, as C. Wright Mills had shown, were becoming gray-flanneled executives like their corporate antagonists. "Negroes" were on the march, of course, but only for the apparently unobjectionable goal of sitting down at the same lunch counters and consuming the same good things available to white Americans. Wherever one looked, America seemed to have risen above the hurts and injustices that kept less-favored nations febrile and restless. Nothing much would change because no important social group had a stake in making change. They were all happily joining the universal middle class.</p><p>Thw Problen of Problemlessness </p><p>If this was the best of times, there was still, inevitably, a flaw. Popular wisdom held that any utopia was bound to be disappointing because "there would be nothing to do," no challenges and no excitement. As evidence, people liked to cite the high suicide rate of the Swedes, who were supposedly enervated by their overprotective welfare state. Now it was as if America had also stumbled into utopia only to confront the ultimate human problem--problemlessness--and with it, the threat of a wasting ennui. "What can we write about?" a college newspaper editor demanded querulously in 1957. "All the problems are solved. All that's left are problems of technical adjustments."</p><p>America's best-known--intellectuals-who were themselves, almost to a man, members of the professional middle class--agreed. "The fundamental political problems of the industrial revolution have been solved," pronounced Seymour Martin Lipset in 1960. There was nothing to do, and certainly nothing worth doing with enthusiasm. After surveying the American scene in 1955, David Riesman and Nathan Glazer taxed their minds to discover an issue that might engage the reformminded. "One could raise the floor under wages," they considered briefly, or "press for socialized medicine," but most people, they concluded, were too comfortable to care. "To be sure," they mused, "there are enclaves where the underprivileged still can be found, as in the Southern Alleghenies or the rural Deep South." But this problem of "underprivilege" was so marginal, so geographically isolated, that it would hardly take a full day's work. "There are still pools of poverty to be mopped up," Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., noted, but then we would be right back to the more vexing problems posed by "an economy of abundance."</p><p>It was the "end of ideology," Daniel Bell announced in 1960, and if no one missed it, this was because no one, perhaps including Bell, seemed to remember what ideology was. Searching for a definition, he kept falling back on the hot word passion: "A total ideology is ... a set of beliefs infused with passion.... What gives ideology its force is its passion." But the waning of passion was hardly worth mourning, for passionate beliefs about society could flower, apparently, only in the harsh ground of inequality, in circumstances where social position was scripted from birth. In "modern" society, occupation and hence status were determined by "technical skill," a purely neutral attribute that anyone could pick up along the way. In this situation, Bell asked rhetorically, "What then is the meaning of class?" Not much, the reader, numbed by ideology's slow death in the author's hands, would have to agree. If there were no deep injustices and only an occasional matter for "technical adjustment," there were surely no inequalities worth getting passionate about.</p></p><h2>Rewriting Your Broken Story: The Power of an Eternal Perspective</h2><p>How do you fix a broken story? In this fallen world, life is often not how we thought it would be. Jobs vanish, relationships crumble, health fails. How do we find the hope to persevere? We can make sense of our broken stories by seeing them in the context of a larger and greater story. Kenneth Boa shows how God can transform our lives with an eternal perspective, when we live with the end in mind. In light of eternity, our struggles are temporary and our plot twists are not fatal. We are hard-wired by God with eternity in our hearts, and that longing gives us purpose, blesses others and helps us make a lasting mark on the world. Knowing our future is crucial to living our present. When we see our stories within his greater story, we learn to live with a heavenly perspective and follow it all the way home.</p><p>Kenneth D. Boa is the president of Reflections Ministries. His many books include <em>Conformed to His Image, 20 Compelling Evidences That God Exists, Face to Face</em> and <em>Augustine to Freud</em>. He resides in Atlanta, Georgia."No one I know has the ability to stretch the mind and encourage the heart quite like Ken Boa. His presentation in this book will help all of us to write a different page in the diaries of our present by seeing the last page from God's perspective. This book will be high on my recommended reading list for the men I meet with and seek to mentor God-ward." (Mark L. Bailey, president, Dallas Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Suffering hits us like nothing else in life. We find ourselves crying out <em>why</em> or thinking we don't deserve it. We may rail at God and what we feel is the unfairness of life or the absence of God's care, but unless we can reframe our trials in light of a good, loving and holy God, our trials will make us bitter. This book is a tonic for the soul and full of solid biblical insight. Few are as qualified, compassionate or practical as Ken in terms of offering good spiritual counsel. I commend this book for your journey." (Stuart McAllister, regional director of the Americas, Ravi Zacharias International Ministries)<br><br>"Relevant, thought provoking and creatively expressed in ways that lead us into new avenues of thinking about old and important issues. In <em>Rewriting Your Broken Story</em>, Boa reminds us that how we ask and answer life's biggest questions will determine the quality of our day-to-day lives here on earth from a spiritual perspective. <em>Rewriting Your Broken Story</em> helps us break through the paradigms that hold us prisoner and prevent us from seeing life the way it really is." (Pat MacMillan, president, Triaxia Partners)<br><br>"S�ren Kierkegaard was right when he said that we have to define life backwards and then live it forwards. It is the arrival that defines the reason for the departure. It is right thinking about life that gives freedom its map. And as Ken Boa observes in this book, 'an eternal perspective will inform us of something more (and better) than what we can see.' Boa has provided a helpful and hopeful map to guide us through life's journey. I know his words will encourage and challenge you." (Ravi Zacharias, author and speaker)<br><br>"Some books inform. Others inspire. This one does both, but with a goal that few books reach. Ken's words have the potential to transform and to lift readers into the larger and eternal story of God. <em>Rewriting Your Broken Story</em> helped me to better see my smaller story as an opportunity to tell God's larger story by how I live." (Larry Crabb, founder and president, NewWay Ministries)<br><br>"Ken Boa is one of my favorite authors, and this book epitomizes why. It's deep, it's practical, it's theological, it's emotionally stirring, and it helped me see life in a way that God longs for me to see it so I can live it in the way he wants me to live it. Highly recommended!" (Chip Ingram, senior pastor, Venture Christian Church, teaching pastor, Living on the Edge)<br><br>"Offering captivating illustrations from an incredible array of angles has long been one of Ken Boa's great gifts. This book is a fascinating journey through history, pop culture, biography, philosophy and the arts. But why take that journey? Because ultimately, we all must wrestle with the fundamental questions of life: Who are we? Why are we here? What's gone wrong? How can we be made whole? This book is a journey through those questions, and Ken a most helpful guide."

Slavitt, <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em></strong></p> One of the most powerful and unsettling Bible stories, <em>The Book of Job</em> undermines the claim that our world is governed by justice and meaning. It does so through a poetry of unsurpassed beauty captured in Raymond Scheindlin's superb new translation. Scheindlin's Job is not a patient sufferer but a defiant man who eloquently demands an argument with God. Job's words land like a fist, but he is left speechless by God's reply from the storm &#x2015; a commanding survey of creation and a challenge to man's place in it. Job's acceptance of God's power comes with a dignity and freshness that makes it compelling even today. In Scheindlin's vivid translation an ancient text speaks to us directly of timeless questions and passions.

To save his son, he summons his trusted colleagues, Chief Inspector of Scotland Yard Ambrose Congreve, former U.S. Navy SEAL Stokley Jones, Jr., and recruits a crack Hostage Rescue Team&#x2014;a group of elite soldiers of fortune known as "Thunder &amp; Lighting." Before they can devise a rescue plan, Hawke must figure out who took his boy&#x2014;and why. An operative who has fought antagonists around the globe, Hawke has made many enemies; one in particular may hold the key to finding Alexei before it&#x2019;s too late.</p><p>But an unexpected threat complicates their mission.

In <i>The Prince of Providence,</i> Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist Mike Stanton tells a classic story of wiseguys, feds, and politicians on a carousel of crime and redemption.<br><br>Buddy Cianci was part urban visionary, part Tony Soprano&#x2014;a flawed political genius in the mold of Huey Long and James Michael Curley. His lust for power cost him his marriage, his family, and close friendships. Yet he also revitalized the city of Providence, where ethnic factions jostle with old-moneyed New Englanders and black-clad artists from the Rhode Island School of Design rub shoulders with scam artists from City Hall. <br><br>For nearly a quarter of a century, Cianci dominated this uneasy melting pot. During his first administration, twenty-two political insiders were convicted of corruption. In 1984, Cianci resigned after pleading guilty to felony assault, for torturing a man he suspected of sleeping with his estranged wife. In 1990, in a remarkable comeback, Cianci was elected mayor once again; he went on to win national acclaim for transforming a dying industrial city into a trendy arts and tourism mecca.<br><br>But in 2001, a federal corruption probe dubbed Operation Plunder Dome threatened to bring the curtain down on Cianci once and for all. <br><br>Mike Stanton takes readers on a remarkable journey through the underside of city life, into the bizarre world of the mayor and his supporting cast, including:<br><br>� &#x201c;Buckles&#x201d; Melise, the city official in charge of vermin control, who bought Providence twice as much rat poison as the city of Cleveland, which was at the time four times as large, and wound up <i>increasing </i>Providence&#x2019;s rat population.

The 1920s saw a flowering of film experimentation, notably with the work of Eisenstein, and a huge growth in the audience for film, which continued into the 1930s with the rise of musicals. The films of the Second World War and Cold War periods reflected a return to political concerns in their representation of the 'enemy'. The 1960s and 1970s saw the rise of art-house films. With glasnost came the collapse of the state-run film industry and an explosion in the cinematic treatment of previously taboo topics. In the new Russia, cinema has become genuinely independent, as a commercial as well as an artistic medium.</p><p>A History of Russian Cinema is the first complete history from the beginning of film to the present day and presents an engaging narrative of both the industry and its key films in the context of Russia's social and political history.</p></p><p>Birgit Beumers is Reader in Russian in the School of Modern Languages at Bristol University.

Her third novel, <i>The Happiest Days of My Life</i>, will be published in 2010. Read her exclusive Amazon guest review of <i>Commencement</i>:</b> <br> <p> </p><p>There is a curious thing that happens to nearly all of us in the haze of our post-college years, and that is this: we anticipate the prospect of becoming honest-to-God adults with both heady excitement and unfathomable dread. Dread because we know, wisely, that once we cross this threshold, we cannot go back; there is no sleeping in past eleven, no immature antics that can still be written off to childhood, no phoning our parents when the checkbook hits zero. Excitement because it is such a relief to evolve into something bigger than we were before, to embrace the world as ready, steady grown-ups. And J. Courtney Sullivan, via her debut novel, <i>Commencement</i>, explores these very complexities and growing pains of leaving behind our adolescences and surrendering to adulthood. </p> <p>As I followed the intertwining paths of her four protagonists, each written honestly and tenderly, I couldn&#x2019;t help but recall my own tangled path toward adulthood, the missteps, the right steps, the paths that have lead to a content life. And this is what the very best fiction does: it draws you in, resonating, asking you to reflect not just on the characters, but yourself. There is Celia, who can&#x2019;t get unstuck from her rut; there is April, whose convictions threaten to overshadow the rest of her life; there is Bree, who faces a choice between her happiness and that of her family&#x2019;s; and there is Sally, who is taping herself back together after the loss of her mother who held her family together. </p> <p>The four of them, united as freshmen at Smith, slowly bond to form their own family, and like even the best of families, they find themselves both dependent and also fractured at various points in their lives. Sullivan does a fabulous job steering the quartet through realistic, life-changing events, events that so many of us have experienced in these growing years that usher us into our thirties. She never loses control of the plots, never lets the characters spill into something false or untrue. An unplanned pregnancy, a dead-end job, a relationship that might be worth salvaging, but who really knows how or if?</p> <p>What I enjoyed most about <i>Commencement</i>, and there were many things&#x2014;the smart writing, the laugh-out-loud dialogue, the ending that I truly couldn&#x2019;t predict&#x2014;was that it reminded me so much of how much I loved those years of my life. And how much I loved my friends who I have been fortunate enough to have along in my journey. I found myself rewinding through memories, sifting through old pictures, smiling as I was reading because Sullivan managed to transport me. She created indelible characters who became part of my life, and thus, allowed my life to become part of her book. This is also what the best fiction does, it pulls you along for the ride as if you were there, as if you were in between the pages, as if Sullivan knew my own story and made it hers. <i>&#x2014;Allison Winn Scotch</i> </p><b>J.

His dark and unsettling short stories and novels were shaped in large part by personal experience (a professional merchant mariner for much of his life, many of Hodgson&#x2019;s tales are set at sea), and his work evokes a disturbing sense of the amorphous and horrific unknown. <br><br> While his nautical adventure fiction was very popular during his lifetime, the supernatural and cosmic horror he is most remembered for only became well known after his death, mainly due to the efforts of writers like H. P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith, who often praised his work and cited it as an influence on their own. By the latter half of the twentieth century, it was only his weird fiction that remained in print, and his vast catalog of non-supernatural stories was extremely hard to find. <br><br> Night Shade Books&#x2019;s five-volume series presents all of Hodgson&#x2019;s unique and timeless fiction. Each volume contains one of Hodgson's novels, along with a selection of thematically-linked short fiction, including a number of works reprinted for the first time since their original publication. The third book of the five-volume set, <i>The Ghost Pirates and Other Revenants of the Sea</i>, collects more of Hodgson&#x2019;s nautical fiction, including his 1909 novel <i>The Ghost Pirates</i>. <br><br><b>The Complete Fiction of William Hope Hodgson is published by Night Shade Books in the following volumes:</b><br><i>The Boats of the &#x201c;Glen Carrig&#x201d; and Other Nautical Adventures</i><br><i>The House on the Borderland and Other Mysterious Places</i><br><i>The Ghost Pirates and Other Revenants of the Sea</i><br><i>The Night Land and Other Romances</i><br><i>The Dream of X and Other Fantastic Visions</i></p><p><b>William Hope Hodgson</b> was an early twentieth-century English author who produced a large and critically acclaimed body of short fiction and novels spanning several overlapping genres, including horror, fantastic fiction, and science fiction. Hodgson was killed in action in WWI in 1918, at the age of forty.</p><h2>Skeleton Key: A Dictionary for Deadheads</h2><p><p>For&nbsp;fifty years and more than two thousand shows, the Grateful Dead have been earning the "deadication" of more than a million fans.

No man has ever perfectly kept all of God's laws&#x2013;except for God's only Son, Jesus. A person will never reach Heaven through his or her own efforts. The Bible says:&nbsp;"<em>Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His [God's] sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin</em>" (Romans 3:20).</p><p>2, 3, or 4&#x2013;Gifts to charity, doing one's best, and leading a good life are commendable acts, but according to the Bible, they will not save anyone:&nbsp;"<em>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us</em>" (Titus 3:5).</p><p>5, 6, or 7&#x2013;Neither good works, trying to obey the Golden Rule, or giving to the church will get you to Heaven. God's Word says:&nbsp;"<em>For by grace ye are saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast</em>" (Ephesians 2:8-9).</p><p>8, 9, 10, 11&#x2013;Church membership, regular church attendance, prayers, and fasting are good in themselves, but they can never justify sinners before a holy God:&nbsp;"<em>We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags</em>" (Isaiah 64:6).</p><p>12 or 13&#x2013;Without trusting in Jesus Christ, baptism and Communion cannot help. The Bible shows clearly that these are of spiritual value only when one believes in Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<em>See Acts 8:12; 1 Corinthians 11:2, 23-32.</em></p><p>14&#x2013;Children born into Christian homes need to be saved just like anyone else.&nbsp;"<em>As many as received Him [Christ], to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His Name: which were born, not of blood [not of one's parentage], nor of the will of the flesh, nor the will of man, but of God</em>" (John 1:12-13).</p><p>15, 16, and 17&#x2013;Neither Confirmation, penances, or extreme unction are the basis for going to Heaven. God has provided only one way of salvation.</p><p>So what is God's only way of salvation? The Bible gives a definite answer. The one and only means of spending eternity with God in heaven is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ alone.</p><p>Because we cannot save ourselves by good works, good character, personal effort, or merit of any kind, God sent His Son to die as a substitute for sinners like you and me. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross and rose again on the third day, He finished the work necessary for salvation. Now all God requires of you is to receive Christ as your Lord and Savior: "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved" (Acts 16:31).</p><p>So when you trust in Jesus you are saved and are destined to spend eternity in Heaven. Jesus said, "He that heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life" (John 5:24).</p><p>Will you accept God's way of salvation? The choice is yours. You may continue to trust in those things listed on page 2. If so, you will go to the grave without Christ and wake up facing God's eternal punishment. Or, you can believe in Jesus Christ and be saved.</p><p>Be wise! Choose Christ! Then indicate the choice you have made below.</p><p>__ My only hope for Heaven is based completely upon the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross. I now accept Him as my personal Lord and Savior.</p></p><p></p><h2>Nature Spirits &amp; Elemental Beings: Working with the Intelligence in Nature</h2><p>Based on firsthand practical experiences of communicating with natural spirits through meditation, this eye-opening guide to healing the earth teaches how to work with elemental beings by describing each in detail while defining their roles within the web of life.

Flowers are beautiful, offering us delight in their color, fragrance and form, as well as their medicinal benefits. Flowers also speak to us in the language of the plant form itself, as cultural symbols in different societies, and at the highest levels of inspiration.</p> <p>In this beautiful and original book, renowned thinker and geometrist Keith Critchlow has chosen to focus on an aspect of flowers that has received perhaps the least attention. &nbsp; This is the flower as teacher of symmetry and geometry (the 'eternal verities', as Plato called them). In this sense, he says, flowers can be treated as sources of remembering -- a way of recalling our own wholeness, as well as awakening our inner power of recognition and consciousness. What is evident in the geometry of the face of a flower can remind us of the geometry that underlies all existence.</p> <p>Working from his own flower photographs and with every geometric pattern hand-drawn, the author reviews the role of flowers within the perspective of our relationship with the natural world. His illuminating study is an attempt to re-engage the human spirit in its intimate relation with all nature.</p></p><p>Professor Keith Critchlow is a well-known lecturer and author.

Rooted in stories from Scripture, his own ministry, and interviews with rural church leaders, Roth offers a sturdy theological and practical alternative to church-growth strategies that rely on success stories and flashy metrics. Reclaiming God's vision for the rural church, Roth writes, means learning how to praise, abide, watch, pray, grow, work the edges, die, befriend, and dream. In God's Country, rediscover the stunning abundance of God's presence in rural communities. Name the ways that the rural church testifies to God's glory and goodness. Learn to live and love and minister right where you are, no matter how small or unassuming it may seem.</p></p><p>Brad Roth serves as pastor at West Zion Mennonite Church in Moundridge, Kansas. He grew up baling hay, tending sheep, and shearing Christmas trees on a farm in Illinois. He is a graduate of Augustana College, Harvard Divinity School, and Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary. Brad has a heart for serving God and God&#39;s people in rural communities. He&#39;s passionate about sharing faith in word and deed, and living out God&#39;s love in the community. He and his wife, Lici, enjoy bicycling, tending a garden, keeping chickens, and playing with their two sons."Brad Roth has done a wonderful, unusual thing: he has thought about the rural church in a way that combines both honesty and hope. He is gentle with the flaws that often beset rural congregations, while at the same time managing to see the small church as a unique servant of God." --Will Willimon, professor of the practice of Christian ministry, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"<i>God's Country<i></i> is a balm to the soul for all who seek the kingdom in rural communities. For anyone who fears that the sun has set on vibrant rural congregations, Brad Roth offers a sage call for hope and renewal. This renewal is not born of imported strategies for church growth. Everything need not change. It begins with 'loving rural' and making one's home among a people formed by ancient ways."<br><br> David Boshart, moderator of Mennonite Church USA<br>" You can sense Brad Roth's love for rural people on every page in this book. . . . This is a book I will assign to divinity students and to a prominent position on my shelf. " --Leonard Sweet, theologian and futurist, from foreword<br><br><p> Drawing on his experience of serving the church in rural Washington, Kansas, and Peru, Brad Roth offers a vivid, uplifting and informed vision for an ecclesioculture that embraces the marginalized rural church. In a time in which rural-urban polarization is increasing, Roth draws on the biblical image of Zion, imagined as a place where holy city and holy rural coexist, equally valued in the body of Christ. This is a book of inspiration for the whole church, in all places. </p> <b> Jeanne Hoeft, coauthor of <i>Practicing Care in Rural Congregations and Communities</i></b> <br> <p> Brad Roth really understands rural ministry it s hard . . . it s beautiful . . . it s dangerous . . . it s worth it! He understands the challenges and yet still loves living and ministering in a rural town. As an author of a book on this same topic, I found <i>God's Country</i> helpful and inspiring, and I think you will too. </p> <b> Donnie Griggs, author of Small Town Jesus and pastor of One Harbor Church, North Carolina</b> <br> <p> <i>God s Country</i> is a beautiful book about a beautiful, vital part of Christianity: the rural church. Brad Roth helps us see the unique characteristics of the rural church without the typical, shallow stereotypes. He tackles our temptation to see only the surface, to either deplore the state of the rural church or romantically glorify it. And best of all, he calls us to love. We choose to tell a story of love, and that story shapes who we become. We love the rural church just like it is, and we love it enough to call it forth to new life. </p> <b> Michele Hershberger, Bible professor, Hesston College</b> <br> <p> Brad Roth deftly weaves his social and theological analysis of the rural church in America with his own challenging experiences in that context. As the writing shifts between a wide-angled analytical lens, and a zoomed-in, standing-in-a-muddy-wheat-field anecdotal lens, readers will come to understand the problem and promise of the rural church in all its complexity. </p> <b> Tom Montgomery Fate, author of Steady and Trembling and Cabin Fever</b><br> <p> <i>God s Country</i> is a balm to the soul for all who seek the kingdom in rural communities.

Few errors in U.S. foreign policy have had longer-lasting or more harmful consequences. Yet how the decision came to be made remains shrouded in mystery and mythology. To this day, even the principal architects of the war cannot agree on it.<br>Michael Mazarr has interviewed dozens of players involved in the deliberations about the invasion of Iraq and has reviewed all the documents so far declassified. He paints a devastating of portrait of an administration fueled by righteous conviction yet undercut by chaotic processes, rivalrous agencies, and competing egos. But more than the product of one bungling administration, the invasion of Iraq emerges here as a tragically typical example of modern U.S. foreign policy fiascos.<i><br></i><i>Leap of Faith</i> asks profound questions about the limits of US power and the accountability for its use.

No, says Michael Mazarr: the truth is actually much darker. Mazarr convincingly argues that the most costly strategic error in modern US history was the result of mistake, blunder, a toxic combination of personality traits among political and military leaders, plus intellectual and moral hubris. <i>Leap of Faith</i> puts the Iraq war in new light, and clarifies why and how such disasters might recur."&#x2015;<b><i>James Fallows, national correspondent at <i>The Atlantic</i> and author of <i>Blind into Baghdad</i> and other books</i></b><br><br>"<i>Leap of Faith</i> should be mandatory reading for every US general and flag officer as well as civilian senior executives; all military officers, especially those at a US senior service college; and every graduate student at an American school of security or international studies.

Now, for the first time, the story of the love of these two glamorous and hugely talented writers can be given in their own letters. Introduced by an extensive narrative of the Fitzgeralds&#39; marriage, the 333 letters - three-quarters of them previously unpublished or out of print - have been edited by the noted Fitzgerald scholars, Jackson R. Bryer and Cathy W. Barks. They are illustrated throughout with a generous selection of familiar and unpublished photographs.</p><p>Jackson R. Bryer is a professor at the University of Maryland. He has edited the Scott Fitzgerald-Maxwell Perkins correspondence and Selected Letters of Eugene O&#39;Neill. Cathy W. Barks teaches American Literature at the University of Maryland"Once we were one person," F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote to his wife in the last years of their marriage, "and always it will be a little that way." While this carefully annotated collection (edited by two scholars at the University of Maryland) is dominated by Zelda's letters more of hers are extant it provides an intimate account of an enduring romantic union (as opposed to the dirty laundry of the Fitzgeralds' spectacular Jazz Age revels and rows or Scott's descent into alcoholism and Zelda's into mental illness). Their cross-Mason-Dixon Line courtship letters begin in 1918, with Zelda displaying her ardor and "mental wickedness" and Scott responding in brief but affectionate telegrams. The Great Depression coincided with Zelda's psychological malaise, and her letters from the '30s are penned from various sanitariums and, later, her family's home in Alabama, where she convalesced under her mother's care. Scott's letters are sufficiently represented only in his final year, when he was exiled to Hollywood as a scriptwriter and had a secretary to keep copies. Among the mutual assurances of love and the occasional long-distance tiffs, Scott and Zelda sometimes discuss art Zelda's search for self-expression in writing, dance and painting; Scott's desire to be "an instrument" for "dark, tragic destiny." Although Scott's letters, typically written in his high lyric style, are unfortunately outnumbered, this collection offers many previously unpublished epistles and photographs as well as an introduction by the Fitzgeralds' granddaughter, and is a moving portrait of a two-decades-long, complicated and deep love affair.

A garden close to the artist&#x2019;s studio is not only convenient for daily material and ideas, but also has the advantage of changing through the seasons and over time. Claude Monet&#x2019;s Giverny was the catalyst for hundreds of great paintings (by Monet and other artists), each one different from the one before. Sometimes a whole village becomes the focus for a colony of artists as at Gerberoy in Picardy and Skagen on the northernmost tip of Denmark.<br> This book is about the real homes and gardens that inspired these great artists &#x2013; gardens that can still be visited today. The relationship between artist and garden is a complex one.

For more seasoned therapists and those seeking to deepen their understanding of psychodynamic therapy, it provides conceptual clarity, and may also serve as a stepping stone to more complex and denser psychoanalytic works written for advanced clinicians.</p><i> <p></p> </i><p><i>Essential Psychodynamic Psychotherapy: An Acquired Art</i> is an introduction to how to think and work psychodynamically. It is written primarily for those training at a postgraduate level in psychoanalysis and psychodynamic psychotherapy, but reaches well beyond that audience. It is grounded in contemporary psychoanalytic theory, drawing on the work of Winnicott, Bion, and Ogden, all of whom are pivotal in current psychodynamic thought and practice. It also integrates attachment theory and research, and includes fresh contributions from neuropsychological research. </p> <p></p> <p>The voice of the book is honest and intimate. The tone is practical. It is written with a clear-minded understanding of contemporary psychodynamic theory that allows the new therapist to access the deepest and richest parts of the therapy itself. It translates many of the key theoretical tenets of psychodynamic psychotherapy, giving the reader a clear (but non-formulaic) guide as to how handle the contours of any analytic session; how to open one&#x2019;s perceptual and emotional apertures as clinician; how to work in and understand "the relationship"; and how to work with the most common intra- and interpersonal problems patients present. This publication will be a valuable guide for new analysts and therapists, and also for those seeking to understand what the world of psychodynamic therapy may hold for them, no matter where they are in their clinical careers. </p> <p></p><b><i> </i></b><i></i><p><i><b>Dr. Teri Quatman</b></i> is an Associate Professor of Counseling Psychology in the Graduate Department of Counseling Psychology at Santa Clara University.

It offers fresh, practical ideas for creating a spiritual dialogue with clients, assessing spirituality as a part of their problems and solutions, and helping them draw on spiritual resources in times of stress. Written from a nonsectarian perspective, the book encompasses both traditional and nontraditional forms of spirituality. It is grounded in current findings from psychotherapy research and the psychology of religion, and includes a wealth of evocative case material.<p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Kenneth I. Pargament, PhD,</b>&nbsp;is Professor of Psychology at Bowling Green State University, where he has been on the faculty since 1979. He has published extensively on the vital role of religion and spirituality in coping with stress and trauma. Dr. Pargament has been a leading figure in the effort to bring a balanced view of religion and spirituality to the attention of scientists and professionals. He is a recipient of the William James Award for excellence in research in the psychology of religion, the Virginia Staudt Sexton Mentoring Award for guiding and encouraging others in the field, and the Oskar Pfister Award for his research and practice in religion and mental health.&nbsp; Dr. Pargament is a practicing clinical psychologist who has worked with people from diverse spiritual backgrounds. In 2011-2012, he will serve as Distinguished Scholar in Residence at the Institute for Spirituality and Health of the Texas Medical Center in Houston. <br>"Kudos! In the best tradition of William James, Pargament highlights the role of spirituality in the lives of clients and psychotherapists and critically examines the assessment and treatment implications. Drawing on research and clinical examples, he describes important and often overlooked ways that attention to spirituality can be integrated into psychotherapy. This book should be of interest to both the novice and seasoned psychotherapist, and will also challenge practitioners and educators in other domains to consider when and how to address issues of spirituality. This is an important book that should stimulate much debate."--Donald Meichenbaum, PhD, Department of Psychology (Emeritus), University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada&nbsp;"From one of our foremost thinkers in psychology and religion, this book provides an up-to-the minute, spiritually informed approach to helping people. The strength of the book is its general applicability for most clients who are spiritually attuned. It is the best available resource of its kind for practicing therapists, and would be a great supplemental text for psychotherapy courses. Easy reading--brilliant thinking."--Everett L. Worthington, Jr., PhD, Department of Psychology, Virginia Commonwealth University&nbsp;"A remarkable combination of clinical acumen and spiritual sensitivity--there is nothing like it in the literature. This book is clearly the work of a mature clinician with a wide range of experiences to draw upon. It offers a wonderful balance of the theoretical and the practical, is genuinely ecumenical and open in its orientation, and is approachable by members of any religious community (or no religious community). Psychotherapists of all persuasions will welcome this book, and it would be an ideal text for any course in spirituality and psychotherapy or pastoral counseling."--James W. Jones, PsyD, PhD, Department of Religion, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey&nbsp;"Exceptional. Pargament offers a sweeping, well-balanced view of spirituality from a clinical perspective, without reducing spirituality to psychology. Through a clear command of existing theory and research, compelling clinical vignettes, wonderful quotations, practical recommendations, and his own gracious therapeutic attitude, Pargament gently reminds the reader that spirituality is a legitimate--often pivotal--dimension of clinical practice. He has 'done the work' for the rest of us who may wonder how to address spirituality within a professional context. Clinicians at all levels of experience will grow by reading, and rereading, this book."--Christopher Germer, PhD, private practice, Arlington, Massachusetts<p>"What is spirituality, as distinct from religiousness? What is its impact on our lives? Are there psychological approaches that incorporate the client's spiritual values and yearnings? Are these approaches effective? Free of jargon and accessible to all mental health professionals, this volume speaks with clarity, sympathy, and wisdom that make it hard to put down. As a therapist, Pargament interweaves the text with delightful clinical vignettes; as a researcher, he explains the studies on spirituality in everyday life and in therapy in a most compelling way. This book is a wake-up call to the mental health profession."--David Greenberg, MD, Department of Psychiatry, Herzog Hospital, and Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel</p>"This is a book for psychotherapists who take spirituality seriously--their own and that of their clients--and who want to include it in their scope of practice as helpers. In clear prose and with many illustrative case examples, Pargament addresses practical issues of providing spiritually integrated therapy and counseling. He cogently argues that spirituality cannot truly be separated from psychotherapy; to practice without considering this vital dimension of human nature is to risk missing, misunderstanding, and mishandling fundamental struggles of the inner life."--William R. Miller, PhD, Departments of Psychology and Psychiatry, (Emeritus), University of New Mexico<br><br>"The author has put together a theory that integrates spirituality with psychotherapy that can help inform both students and practitioners interested in this still-emerging area of practice.

He details ways that spirituality can be of invaluable help in a client's psychological struggles.

Next, Pargament discusses ways of addressing spirituality in psychotherapy....The volume is filled with concrete and practical examples that clearly illustrate Pargament's concepts....This volume is important and well timed....Illuminates the ways that psychotherapy ultimately is a journey into the mystery of the other.

So the question arises: Do we really need another edition of Puss? Presented with Fred Marcellino's magnificent interpretation of this nimble new translation of the authentic text, book lovers young and old are apt to decide that this <i>Puss in Boots</i> belongs on their shelf of special favorites.</p><p>Long regarded as the preeminent designer of book jackets in America, Fred Marcellino provides an unstinting visual feast in his first full-color picture book. The adventures of that rascal, Puss, and his master, the miller's son, are portrayed in a lavish series of illustrations that range from sumptuous grandeur to comedy both boisterous and sly.<br><i>Puss in Boots</i> is a 1991 Caldecott Honor Book.</p></p><p>Charles Perrault first published his collection of classic French folk tales 300 years ago, including "Cinderella," "Sleeping Beauty," and this entertaining story about a most clever feline. In <i>Puss and Boots</i>, a poor miller dies and leaves his youngest son nothing but a cat. The son is none too happy about it, either; " ...once I've eaten my cat and made a muff out of the fur, I'm sure to starve," he says. But what a legacy the bequeathed cat turns out to be! The cat in tall boots creates a new identity for the youngest son--the Marquis of Carabas, complete with fine clothes, fields of wheat, a castle stolen from an ogre, and in the end, the respect of the king and the hand of the king's daughter. The story itself is gracefully and humorously told, and the text, set in large gray type, adds an old-fashioned air to the tale.<p> Fred Marcellino's illustrations for <i>Puss in Boots</i>--a Caldecott Honor Book--are infused with golden light and summer warmth in the sun-dappled woods and beside the fields of ripe grain. Many of his paintings show a masterful use of perspective; the reader sometimes looks down on a scene as though from a balcony, or from below, at a huge charging lion. Marcellino has also illustrated a version of Hans Christian Andersen's <i>The Steadfast Tin Soldier</i> and two books by Tor Seidler, <i>A Rat's Tale</i> and <i>The Wainscott Weasel</i>. Young listeners won't soon forget this crafty character of a cat, who has a great deal of charm despite his less-than-honest means of helping his master. <i>(Ages 5 to 9)</i></p><p><b>CHARLES PERRAULT</b> (1628&#x2013;1703) is considered the original creator of the fairy tale, having written such classics as <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>, <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>, and <i>Cinderella</i>.</p><p><b>FRED MARCELLINO</b> (1939&#x2013;2001) began his career in illustration with <i>A Rat's Tale</i> (available from Farrar Straus Giroux). <i>Puss in Boots</i> was his first full-color picture book and a Caldecott Honor winner. He continued to win awards and receive critical acclaim for his children's books until his death in 2001.</p></p><h2>On Writing</h2><p><p>Sharp and moving reflections and ruminations on the artistry and craft of writing from one of our most iconoclastic, riveting, and celebrated masters.</p><p>Charles Bukowski&#x2019;s stories, poems, and novels have left an enduring mark on our culture.

With that said, sometimes we need a little push to get ourselves over the line (or rather, out of the bed) and to fully wake ourselves up in the morning.<br><br>In this chapter we'll speak with (among others) the president of MIT, L. Rafael Reif, about how he spends his first few hours upon waking; the executive director of the American Society for Muslim Advancement, Daisy Khan, on how the month of Ramadan brings a big change to her mornings; and economist and author Tyler Cowen on his unique take on breakfast (smoked trout and cheese, anyone?).<br><br>Caroline Paul<br><br>Author of Lost Cat, former firefighter<br><br>When you're a creature of habit, and you're in no rush to change.<br><br>What is your morning routine?<br><br>I set an alarm for anywhere between 6:00 and 6:30 a.m., depending on when I get to sleep. I need sleep, but I need to wake up early more, or my day feels shot.<br><br>Next I make coffee, feed the milling animals, grab two protein bars, and sit down to read. Not the newspaper, though I do often check the headlines, but a real, honest-to-God book. If one's not around I will settle for the New Yorker. It's a sacred time for me, because reading has always been a part of my life and it's hard to find time for it. As a writer, it's also a vital part of my work. At this time, my partner, Wendy, is still asleep, the doggie has gone back to bed, one cat has gone outside, so there are only two other animals to contend with, one a cat and she curls up on my lap, and the other my own rambling mind, and we both stay there until the house stirs and comes to life. I have to say that the transition from the world being mine to the moment it seems to splinter and everyone wakes up-phones ring, emails come in, the dog reappears-is always jarring.<br><br>How long have you stuck with this routine? What has changed?<br><br>I've started my day with the same meal and coffee (Peets French roast, one large cup, so strong you could probably eat it with a spoon) for almost thirty years. Gosh, that's sort of embarrassing, seeing that so starkly on paper. But that consistency first thing grounds me, and sets me up to be able to handle whatever is thrown my way.<br><br>When I was a firefighter I didn't read in the morning, and I was a little looser about my wake-up time because you never knew how much of the night would be spent working at a fire or on medical calls, and I'm useless without sleep.<br><br>When I became a full-time writer and had to make my own schedule I became adamant about setting the alarm and getting up. I needed the structure, and I needed to start back on whatever book I was writing before the morning slipped away. People think that when you work outside of an office you can sleep in and how glorious that must be, but to me that's the road to discombobulation and dismay.<br><br>Have you always used an alarm to wake up?<br><br>Always. I've tried to train myself to wake up without one because it seems like a cool superpower, but I spend all night thinking about whether I'll wake up, and the anxiety isn't worth it. Once the alarm goes off, I sort of doze, but I have a dog and two cats who have heard the alarm and stare at me until I get up. It's called the animal snooze button.<br><br>What time do you go to sleep?<br><br>I would love to go to bed by 9:00 p.m. every evening. I'm just not a night person. Once the sun goes down I think, huh, not much to do anymore, and I sort of begin to look forward to the next morning already.<br><br>How does your partner fit into your morning?<br><br>Wendy's best work (she's an illustrator) is done at night, so she doesn't value her mornings like I do. This works because I get my quiet morning and she gets to sleep without me tossing and turning.<br><br>Do you also follow this routine on weekends?<br><br>I like to get up early no matter what, but I may not set the alarm, in deference to Wendy. If I'm writing on a Saturday or Sunday, though, then I set the alarm like it's a weekday.<br><br>What happens if you're traveling?<br><br>When we travel my bag is always overweight because it's got maybe two pants and two shirts and then thirty protein bars, five books, and a bag of coffee. Wendy will say, "Caroline, it's NEW YORK CITY, they have everything!" But, nope, I'm not going to leave my morning routine to chance. Wendy is much more loosey-goosey with her days. She used to pester me to lighten the load, but it's been nine years and she doesn't bother anymore.<br><br>James Freeman<br><br>Founder of Blue Bottle Coffee<br><br>When your old espresso machine gets you up in the morning and helps you make your most important decisions.<br><br>What is your morning routine?<br><br>I get up at 6:00 a.m. most days, unless the babies get me up before. I have an alarm clock with no snooze bar, so I can't be tempted to hit it. I have an old espresso machine (a late 1970s La San Marco Leva) that is set on a timer, so when I wake up the machine has been warming up and is at optimal temperature for making coffee.<br><br>After I get up, I make a cappuccino for me and a caf au lait for my wife. I'm less optimistic before I have coffee, so my general rule is not to make any important decisions before I have it.<br><br>If I'm lucky, I have ten to twenty minutes to chat with my wife and read the New York Times in bed as we drink our coffee. Sometimes the dog needs to go out during this time and I have to be okay with it.<br><br>I leave for my workout at around 6:45. Post-workout, I shower, eat breakfast, feed and dress the babies, dress myself, and hop in the car. I usually have a playlist in mind for the drive to Oakland. I used to listen to NPR but it just got too depressing.<br><br>How long have you stuck with this routine? What has changed?<br><br>Several years. As we add babies, my mornings get more hectic, but so far everyone is getting what they need.<br><br>Do you do anything before bed to make your morning easier?<br><br>The kitchen is always cleaned and the house tidied before we go to bed. It's hard to fit it in but it's gratifying to wake up to a peaceful environment.<br><br>How soon after waking up do you have breakfast?<br><br>I eat breakfast when I get back from my workout. Usually a yogurt and fruit smoothie, or just yogurt, jam, and chopped raw almonds. My favorite yogurt is an organically certified, full fat, Jersey milk yogurt from Saint Beno&#x201d;t.<br><br>Do you have a morning workout routine?<br><br>Four days a week I do a boot camp in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. It's exhausting and arduous and clears my mind like nothing else I've ever done. The teacher gives the impression of never wanting to be anywhere else doing anything else, which is quite rare, in my experience.<br><br>Do you use any apps or products to enhance your morning routine?<br><br>Is a coffee maker a product? Pajamas? A nice robe? Maybe I'm just too old but I don't believe that one's life can be hacked; it can only be lived.<br><br>What are your most important tasks in the morning?<br><br>Once I get to work, I try to concentrate most deeply on the people or problems that are in front of me, so, in that sense, my most important task prior to arriving at work is to arrive with a clear head and a pleasant attitude.<br><br>What happens if you're traveling?<br><br>I travel with a coffee kit so I can have control over making coffee. I have an app on my phone that I use to do an interval workout if I am away from San Francisco. Running in the parks and neighborhoods of great cities when I travel is a pleasure. I try not to schedule myself too early when I'm traveling so I can fit in a coffee and a run each morning.<br><br>Andre D. Wagner<br><br>Artist, New York City street photographer<br><br>When your creative job requires you to be "on" all day long.<br><br>What is your morning routine?<br><br>I usually wake up around 6:00 a.m. to have some silent time to myself. I also keep a journal, so some days I'll write.<br><br>When I'm not photographing for hire, I'm usually out the door by 7:00 or 7:30 with my camera in hand, ready to enjoy the day. My routine changes from time to time, but I always wake up early. The morning is by far my favorite time of day. As a street photographer, I'm always engaging with people, watching people, walking all day, and being fully stimulated all at the same time. Days become full and draining. It's important that I get some quiet time to myself; it helps me stay balanced in such an emotional city.<br><br>When I'm working on photo projects I will adapt my routine to it. Two years ago when I was working in a photo studio, I would leave my house at 7:00 because I wanted to photograph in the subway for an hour or two before I had to be at work. Now that it's summertime and the light is so beautiful when the sun is rising I like to get out and take advantage of it.<br><br>Do you do anything before bed to make your morning easier?<br><br>I'm a neat freak and I like everything to be clean. Waking up to a clean apartment is the absolute best. It keeps my mind clear.<br><br>Do you have a morning workout routine?<br><br>Two or three times a week I'll ride my bike to Prospect Park and do a lap or two. It's great because there aren't many people out yet, and the park is pretty quiet. My favorite is in the fall, when we start to get that brisk morning air.<br><br>How about morning meditation?<br><br>Waking up in a clean apartment, beautiful light shining through my windows, and Miles Davis playing is my meditation.<br><br>When do you first check your phone?<br><br>I'll check my phone before I leave the house, but I try not to check it while I'm in bed. When I'm waking up I like to keep a space for my own thoughts and ideas. Sometimes there's nothing, and that's totally fine. On occasion, I'll think of something that will add to a project I'm working on, or just reflect on something that impacted me, whether an interaction from photography or just a personal exchange. When I wake up, checking my phone is not a priority of mine.<br><br>L. Rafael Reif<br><br>President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)<br><br>When staying on top of the news feels like a full-time job.<br><br>What is your morning routine?<br><br>I set my alarm for 6:00 a.m. but I rarely get to hear it-I almost always wake up around 5:00 or 5:30 on my own.<br><br>The moment I wake up I drink a glass of water, then I check my email. As MIT is global on so many levels, I try to stay current on what's going on around the world, and I want to know what happened overseas during the night. I'll try to respond to any urgent messages right away, then I take my phone or tablet to breakfast and read the news while I eat.<br><br>After breakfast I shower, get dressed, and then I'm off to my first meeting of the day.<br><br>What time do you go to sleep?<br><br>I try to go to bed around 11:00 p.m. I always read something, a magazine or a book, before lights out. I start reading that week's edition of the Economist on Saturdays, and that lasts me for a few days. Then I'll move on to a book for the rest of the week. I love reading history books and biographies; it's fascinating to look back at what happened, why it happened, and who made it happen.<br><br>Do you do anything before bed to make your morning easier?<br><br>Before I wrap up for the night, I look at the next day's schedule to see what my staff has gotten me into over the next twenty-four hours!<br><br>I use a fitness/sleep tracker. It tells me how many hours I slept and the quality of my sleep. It's a curiosity more than anything else. I love data, and I love comparing what the data says about my rest to how I think I slept.<br><br>How soon after waking up do you have breakfast?<br><br>Once I've responded to any urgent emails from overnight, I go downstairs for breakfast. My wife usually wakes up around the same time and joins me. We both read the news while having breakfast and comment to each other on the issues of the day.<br><br>What happens if you fail?<br><br>If I don't have a chance to check my email, I worry about what I'm missing. (Even when I do check my email, I still worry!) And it happens rarely, but if I miss breakfast for some reason, it throws me off for the whole day. The word "grumpy" comes to mind.<br><br>Daisy Khan<br><br>Executive director of the American Society for Muslim Advancement<br><br>When Ramadan wakes you up for dawn prayers, and you go back to sleep on a full stomach.<br><br>What is your morning routine?<br><br>My wake-up time depends on the fluctuating prayer time (I adjust my wake-up time accordingly). Ramadan is a month when the body, soul, and mind not only get challenged but transformed as well. This Ramadan is really tough; I sleep at midnight, wake up from my deep sleep at 3:15 a.m. to eat a meal (suhur), then I finish my dawn prayer and go back to sleep on a full stomach at 4:30, only to wake up again at 8:30 to go to work.<br><br>How soon after waking up do you have breakfast?<br><br>I have to maintain an alkaline diet, so I drink lemon water right after getting up. I'll then eat a very healthy breakfast about two hours later, because I skip lunch. I start with black tea with milk (an English-breakfast variety), cooked fava beans (protein), cucumbers, arugula, or eggs, with gluten-free bread and homemade jams (made by me).</p><h2>Out of the Forests: The Art of Paul Bonner</h2><p>Barely contained within this book is the high octane work of Paul Bonner, an intrepid artist able to vividly recall in paints his visits to Valhalla, the blasted future, and sundry haunted and ravaged stopping off points in between.<br><br>Here you will find over 150 of Paul's vibrant and compelling full colour paintings, along with numerous character studies and sketches, produced by the artist over the last<b> t</b>wenty-five years for the biggest names in fantasy role playing, such as Games Workshop, Mutant Chronicles, Fasa, Riot Minds and Rackham.<br><br>So, saddle the dragon storm riders, suit up storm troopers, and prepare to have your worlds revealed anew!</p><p>A graduate of Harrow School of Art, over the last 25+ years <b>Paul Bonner</b> has produced work for all the big names in fantasy role playing: Games Workshop, Mutant Chronicles, Fasa, Riot Minds and Rackham, as well as winning numerous awards for his vivid &#x201c;photo-real&#x201d; fantasy artwork.</p><h2>The Farm in the Green Mountains (NYRB Classics)</h2><p><b><i>The Farm in the Green Mountains</i> is a story of a refugee family finding its true home&#x2014;thousands of miles from its homeland.</b><br><br>Alice and Carl Zuckmayer lived at the center of Weimar era Berlin. She was a former actor turned medical student, he was a playwright, and their circle of friends included Stefan Zweig, Alma Mahler, and Bertolt Brecht. But then the Nazis took over and Carl&#x2019;s most recent success, a play satirizing German militarism, impressed them in all the wrong ways. The couple and their two daughters were forced to flee, first to Austria, then to Switzerland, and finally to the United States. Los Angeles didn&#x2019;t suit them, neither did New York, but a chance stroll in the Vermont woods led them to Backwoods Farm and the eighteenth-century farmhouse where they would spend the next five years. In Europe, the Zuckmayers were accustomed to servants; in Vermont, they found themselves building chicken coops, refereeing fights between fractious ducks, and caring for temperamental water pipes &#x201c;like babies.&#x201d; But in spite of the endless work and the brutal, depressing winters, Alice found that in America she had at last discovered her &#x201c;native land.&#x201d; This generous, surprising, and witty memoir, a best seller in postwar Germany, has all the charm of an unlikely romantic comedy.</p><p><b>Alice Herdan-Zuckmayer</b> (1901&#x2013;1991) was born Alice Henriette Alberta Herdan-Harris von Valbonne und Belmont in Vienna shortly after her parents&#x2019; divorce. As a girl, she was a pupil of the radical education reformist Eugenie Schwarzwald and Alice met her first husband, the psychologist and future anti-Nazi leader Karl Frank, through Schwarzwald. Her marriage to Frank was short lived and Alice, now living in Berlin with their daughter Michaela, supported herself by acting and with secretarial work, though she hoped to become a doctor. She met the writer Carl Zuckmayer at a party of actors and artists, and the two married in 1925, the same year Zuckmayer was awarded the Kleist Prize for his play <i>The Merry Vineyard</i>. The next year she gave birth to a second daughter, Maria Winnetou. By 1933 Zuckmayer&#x2019;s works had been banned and the family moved, first to Austria, and then, in 1938, to Switzerland. They emigrated to the United States with the help of the journalist Dorothy Thompson in 1939.

This change is perhaps nowhere more clearly seen than in the relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children.

Our society presents Christian parents and children with a uniqu opportunity of bearing witness of God&#39;s love by just being different. Few things are more powerful than a Christian family in which the true relationship between poarents and children is clearly seen.

Now, almost 50 years later, the original 249 episodes still remain among the most frequently watched syndicated shows on television. In 1991, Neal Brower began to write a regular column called "Professor Brower's Class" in&nbsp;<i>The Bullet</i>, the newsletter for the show's fan club,&nbsp;<i>The Andy Griffith Show&nbsp;Rerun Watchers Club</i>.&nbsp;<i>The Bullet</i>, which was published three times a year, was distributed to approximately 15,000 members of the 1,000 worldwide chapters. In his column, Brower focused on one of the show's episodes. Through interviews with writers, directors, producers, actors, and other people associated with the show, Brower offered insights into the scriptwriting, production, photography, casting, and musical scoring. Although Brower's first few columns consisted primarily of his personal observations and comments about the episode, later columns concentrated on letting the participants tell the Mayberry story. Brower realized that the pace of writing only three episodes a year was too slow a process. The stories that he discovered needed to be told before the memories faded. This book resulted from the need to tell the story in a more timely format. In this volume, Brower focuses on the 79 episodes written by Harvey Bullock, Everett Greenbaum, Sam Bobrick, and their partners. These writers were responsible for such popular episodes as "Opie the Birdman," "Mr. McBeevee," "My Fair Ernest T. Bass," "The Pickle Story," "A Date for Gomer," and "The Darlings Are Coming." When asked if he would help with this project, writer Everett Greenbaum responded, "Neal, I will be glad to answer your questions because I feel it is important to keep the memories alive." Thanks to Everett and all who shared their observations,&nbsp;<em>Mayberry 101</em>&nbsp;now preserves a behind-the-scenes peak at the Mayberry story.</p> <p>Neal Brower, a United Methodist minister, teaches a ten-week course about <i>The Andy Griffith Show</i>&nbsp;at community colleges throughout North Carolina.

Those sailing away in defeat from this captured bastion are members of an anachronistic crusading order called the Knights of St. John -- otherwise known as the Hospitallers. Among the dejected company is a stalwart young knight named Jean Parisot De La Valette. Were it up to him, the order would have defended the island to the bitter end. Forty-two years later, history has repeated itself. The Hospitallers are again besieged by the teeming armies of the relentless Turk. Their tiny island-fortress of Malta is all that stands between the armies of Suleiman and the very heart of Christendom. But this time the scenario is different -- La Valette wears the Grand Master&#39;s cape. Behind him stand the knights of his faithful order: men of incredible valor ready to &#34;strike a blow for Christ&#34; and sacrifice their lives to halt the invading Turks at the gates of Europe. What follows is a desperate struggle between East and West, Cross and Koran, faith and despair. Angels in Iron is based on the actual events surrounding the Siege of Malta in 1565. Nicholas C. Prata relates the tale in riveting and graphic prose which brings the extreme heroism of the knights and the unimaginable horror of combat sharply into focus.

This letter, from a young Peggy Parish fan, comes as no surprise to the teachers and librarians who have put her books in the hands of children over the years. Ms. Parish wrote nearly three dozen children's books-many of which include her most famous character, the literal-minded maid named Amelia Bedelia. </p> <p> Peggy Parish knew what children like to read. After graduating from the University of South Carolina with a degree in English, she taught school in Oklahoma, Kentucky, and, for over 15 years, at the well-known, progressive Dalton School in New York City. It was at Dalton that she began to find ways to release her creative ideas and energy, Though she never took a writing course, "writing stories for children came naturally." Her first book, published in 1961, was followed with <i>Let's Be Indians</i> and in 1963 with her unforgettable <i>Amelia Bedelia.</i> </p> <p> Always involved with education in some way, Peggy Parish did television pieces on preschool education and children's books, wrote children's-book review columns, and led numerous in-service training workshops for teachers. In discussing her ideas about education, she said, "Children's rights are taken away from them when they enter school. What I try to show teachers is that all the skills needed to read can be taught outside of textbooks. Today's children are not going to read what they are not interested in. And if a positive attitude toward reading is not developed during the first three years of school, it is virtually impossible to develop it later." </p> <p> After living in New York for many years, Peggy Parish returned to her native South Carolina. She died in November, 1988. But Ameila Bedelia did not die. Peggy Parish's nephew, Herman Parish, has written <i>Good Driving, Amelia Bedelia </i>and <i>Bravo, Amelia Bedelia!</i>, published by Greenwillow Books in 1995 and 1997 respectively. </p>Text: Spanish (translation)<br> Original Language: English</p><h2>Ancestral Dietary Strategy to Prevent and Treat Macular Degeneration: Standard Print Black and White Paperback Edition</h2><p>Could a simple, all-natural, whole-foods diet - the same diet of our 19th century and previous ancestors - both prevent and treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD)? According to the hypothesis and supportive research of author, Chris A. Knobbe, MD, the answer is a resounding yes. Dr. Knobbe is a both an ophthalmologist and Associate Clinical Professor Emeritus, formerly of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and he has proffered a revolutionary hypothesis for the cause of AMD, a hypothesis which holds that AMD is a disease both initiated and driven by man-made, processed, nutrient-deficient, and toxic food consumption. Knobbe&#39;s hypothesis, originally developed in late 2013, has been thoroughly researched - and virtually every last shred of evidence supports the hypothesis. Dr. Knobbe headed a research project with colleague nutrition researcher, Marija Stojanosak, MSc and several ophthalmologists in the South Pacific Islands, where AMD is rare. By correlating processed food consumption to AMD prevalence in 25 nations around the world, Knobbe found that, indeed wherever processed food consumption was greatest, AMD prevalence was highest, and wherever processed food consumption was rare (such as the Pacific Island nations of Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Kiribati), AMD was extremely rare. In short, the evidence strongly supports the hypothesis, which has major implications for both preventing and treating AMD. Knobbe&#39;s revolutionary hypothesis and supportive research is published in the November, 2017 issue of the highly regarded journal, Medical Hypotheses. He has also presented his hypothesis and supportive research more than two dozen times to both scientific and lay audiences, all around the United States, including presentations at the Ancestral Health Symposium in 2016, 2018, and 2019, the Weston A. Price Foundation in 2017 and 2018, the Christian Ophthalmology Society in 2018, and in numerous cities for the Macular Degeneration Association. Knobbe&#39;s hypothesis, supportive research, writings, and presentations have received tremendous accolades from both colleagues and fellow nutrition researchers. Ophthalmologist and retina specialist of the United Kingdom, Andrew J. Luff, MA, FRCS, FRCS(Ophtha), FRCOphth, writes, &#34;As the prevalence of AMD escalates, the devastating consequences of visual loss take their relentless toll on individuals, families, and health economies. This epidemic continues to grow, oblivious to a plethora of research. A massive financial investment (both University-based and pharmaceutical) has made no impact on the incidence of a disease that has resisted minor nutritional tinkering and seen no significant gain from our exponentially increased knowledge of genetics. In researching our frustrating lack of success in the quest for a unifying cause of AMD, Dr. Knobbe concludes that we have been looking in the wrong place. From a meticulous examination of ophthalmic history, comparative epidemiology and dietary change across the globe, he constructs a cogent and compelling argument for defects in basic nutrition as the fundamental driver of AMD. The data are stark and the potential consequences of dietary deficiency sobering. Dr. Knobbe&#39;s rational conclusion that a shift from traditional foods can wreak havoc on macular function will come as no surprise to those who have postulated similar cause for the multitude of chronic diseases now endemic in so-called developed nations. His hypothesis is unlikely to be welcomed by those committed to pharmacological intervention. Furthermore, a radical change to the diet of billions will not happen quickly. However, for newly diagnosed patients seeking hope and clinicians struggling for an answer, Dr. Knobbe&#39;s remarkable book offers the first tangible lifeline... The visual health of many millions of people worldwide over the coming decades may depend on whether Knobbe&#39;s message is heard...&#34; Proceeds support Cure AMD Foundation.</p><p>Chris A. Knobbe, MD is an ophthalmologist and Associate Clinical Professor Emeritus, formerly of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, in Dallas, Texas. Dr. Knobbe, a native of Colorado, graduated from the University of Colorado School of Medicine in 1990, completed a transitional internship at Denver Presbyterian/St. Luke&#39;s Medical Centers, and then a three-year ophthalmology residency at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, in Denver. After seven years in private practice, Knobbe joined the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center as an Assistant Clinical Professor, a position he held until 2017. On a more personal note, at the age of 34, Dr. Knobbe began to suffer with arthritis, which progressed markedly over the next 16 years. At the age of 50 and after seeking the advice and treatment of nearly a dozen physician colleagues, Knobbe finally found dramatic relief - however, not by any traditional medicine or procedure - but rather by altering his diet towards a more &#34;Paleo&#34; way of eating. This was a life-changing event for Knobbe, which sparked his interest in discovering as much as possible about the prophylactic and healing powers of food. The nutritional journey was a long and arduous one with peaks and valleys, until Knobbe discovered the research of Weston A. Price. Price completed an epic volume of nutritional anthropology and wrote a nutritional treatise in his book entitled, Nutrition and Physical Degeneration, which was published in 1939 followed by a second edition in 1945. Price detailed numerous discoveries in a nearly decade-long interval of on-the-ground research, in which he evaluated numerous populations on five continents as they transitioned from native, traditional diets, to Westernized diets, the latter of which were replete with man-made, processed, nutrient-deficient and toxic foods. Such diets led to numerous diseases of civilization and the previously healthy suffered numerous maladies. In 2013, Knobbe envisioned that Westernized food consumption might also be the primary driver of the disease age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss and blindness worldwide. This led to a revolutionary hypothesis, that is, that AMD might be a disease of processed food consumption, rather than a disease caused by aging and genetics as allopathic ophthalmology has believed for decades. In early 2015, with enough research to believe that the hypothesis would be supported by epidemiologic evidence, Knobbe left practice to pursue investigation of the hypothesis on a full-time basis. Some eighteen months later, the fundamental research with AMD prevalence correlated to processed food consumption in 25 nations was complete. More importantly, the evidence strongly supported the hypothesis. On August 12, 2016, Dr. Knobbe made the debut presentation of his revolutionary hypothesis for the cause of AMD at the Ancestral Health Symposium, held at the University of Colorado Boulder. He&#39;s made dozens of presentations in cities across the U.S. since then, published a scientific paper in the journal Medical Hypotheses, and has founded Cure AMD Foundation(TM), the latter being a nonprofit organization with 501(c)(3) status in support of this cause. Dr. Knobbe&#39;s hypothesis, scientific paper and book, while accepted by numerous physicians and ophthalmologists, has not resulted in broad supportive dietary advice by mainstream allopathic ophthalmology. However, ancestral nutrition researchers and progressive physicians now understand that the exact same advice (ancestral diets) is preventing all the diseases of civilization, including heart disease, hypertension, stroke, cancers, type 2 diabetes, obesity, autoimmune disorders, and so much more. Thus, Dr. Knobbe continues his work -- at saving vision. Come join those who are saving their own vision, in this revolution!<p>"In our opinion, Dr. Knobbe has uncovered an important connection between diet and age-related macular degeneration that has the potential to prevent hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people from progressing to the advanced stages of this disease.</p><p> -- Editorial Board, Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation, Price-Pottenger Journal of Health and Healing, Summer - 2017</p><p><strong>____________________________________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p>"I have found Dr Knobbe's theory well researched and presented in his book. Although no one can accurately say exactly what the incidence of AMD was in the early 1900's, he presents a compelling argument, based in fact, that not only is AMD on the rise and reaching epidemic proportions, but it's coincident with the introduction of processed, nutrient deficient, foods. Perhaps most compelling is, after reading his book, I now find myself taking extra chair time to discuss dietary issues with my patients. I would say this is a must read for any eyecare provider, but particularly those practicing primary eyecare with the goal of preventing AMD." </p><p>-- Micah W. Rothstein, MD Ophthalmologist, Eye Care Center of Northern Colorado<br> <br> ______________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>"Dr. Knobbe's thesis that macular degeneration is due to dietary causes is well-supported by his research. Drawing on the observations of Dr. Weston A. Price, who studied traditional cultures living on unrefined and unprocessed foods, the author makes his point quite clearly: Our present-day diet is a major culprit in the proliferation of not only AMD, but most likely for many other degenerative diseases of civilization as well. Here is where so many current studies are woefully behind; the answers are right in front of us if we dare to look. Dr. Knobbe has done just that, and he deserves great credit for bringing this topic to the public with this very readable book."</p><p>-- Ed Bennett, President, Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation</p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br> <br> "Dr. Knobbe, I heard your lecture at the Christian Ophthalmology Society meeting. I want to congratulate you on your research into your discovery/hypothesis as I found it to be profound and surprising. It has potential to alleviate more preventable blindness than any multi-billion dollar anti-VEGF [wet AMD drugs] industry. I just wanted to encourage your efforts and hopefully this isn't something that's looked back on in a century as a missed opportunity."<br> <br> -- Jonathan P.

When they reached the clearing, James rolled to a stop and shoved the car into park.<br> <br>Tessa gazed straight ahead at the moonlight shimmering off the inky lake.<br> <br>&#x201c;This okay?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>He turned off the music, and she listened to the drone of the cicadas and the guttural croak of bullfrogs outside. An electronic chirp sounded from her purse. Crickets, her sister&#x2019;s ringtone. Tessa silenced the phone and dropped it into the cup holder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;No one.&#x201d;<br> <br>The car got quiet again and James reached for her, pulling her across the seat and sliding his warm hand under her shirt.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait. Maybe we should talk first.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have much time.&#x201d; He squeezed her breast.<br> <br>&#x201c;James, I mean it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He leaned back and sighed. &#x201c;Talk about what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Us. This.&#x201d;<br> <br>His face was shadowed, but still she could see the heat in his eyes as his hand glided up her thigh.<br> <br>&#x201c;So talk.&#x201d; He kissed her neck, and she inhaled the musky scent of his skin&#x2014;the scent that drew her to him in the most primal way, in a way she&#x2019;d never been able to resist no matter what the consequences. She responded to this man on a molecular level, with every cell in her body.<br> <br>He kissed her mouth, softly at first, then harder. He pulled her close, shifting her until she was almost in his lap.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stop thinking about you.&#x201d; His breath was warm against her throat, and whatever she&#x2019;d wanted to talk about was gone now. He slid his hand over her shirt, deftly popping open the buttons one by one. Then the fabric was off her shoulders, and air wafted over her skin. She reached for his belt buckle.<br> <br>A sudden flash of light made her jump. She squinted over her shoulder at the blinding white as a car pulled up behind them.<br> <br>James went rigid. &#x201c;Damn it, a cop.&#x201d;<br> <br>The car&#x2019;s door opened. She hurriedly pulled her shirt on and darted a look at James.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>A light beamed into the driver&#x2019;s side, and she shrank back against the door as James buzzed down the window.<br> <br>&#x201c;Evening, Officer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This your vehicle, sir?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, it is.&#x201d;<br> <br>The flashlight beam moved to Tessa&#x2019;s face, then dipped lower. She tugged the sides of her shirt together and looked away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Step out of the car, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>James gave her a warning look and pushed open his door.<br> <br>She sank down in the seat. Perfect. This was just what they needed. Could they be charged with something? Trespassing? Or public lewdness, maybe? Her cheeks burned and she glanced back at the cop.<br> <br>Pervert. He probably staked out this lakeside park every weekend and waited for couples to pull in. He probably got a sick thrill from embarrassing people.<br> <br>Pop! Pop!<br> <br>The noise rocked the car and she lurched against the window, shrieking. Terror seized her as she gaped at the open door.<br> <br>He&#x2019;s shooting. He&#x2019;s shooting. He&#x2019;s&#x2014;<br> <br>The flashlight shifted. Tessa scrambled for the door handle. She shoved open the door and lunged from the car, landing hard on her hands and knees.<br> <br>Pop!<br> <br>The sound reverberated through her brain, her universe. She clawed at the grass and stumbled to her feet. Adrenaline spurted through her veins as she raced for the woods.<br> <br>He was behind her, right behind her. She sprinted for the cover of the trees, screaming so loud her throat burned.<br> <br>No one can hear you. You&#x2019;re all alone.<br> <br>An icy wave of panic crashed over her, and her cries became a shrill wail. Her heart pounded as she ran and ran, waiting for the bite of a bullet.<br> <br>Hide, hide, hide!<br> <br>She plunged into the woods, choking back her screams as she swiped madly at the branches. Thorns tore at her skin, her clothes, but she surged forward. It was dark. So dark. Maybe he wouldn&#x2019;t see her in the thicket.<br> <br>He killed James. He killed him killed him killed him. The words flashed through her mind as she swatted at the branches.<br> <br>She had to get out of here. She had to get help. But she was miles away from anyone, stumbling blindly through the darkness. Branches lashed her cheeks and they were wet with blood or tears or both as she plunged through razor-sharp brush and her breath came in shallow gasps.<br> <br>She tripped and crashed to her knees. Pain zinged up her legs, but she pushed to her feet and kept going, deeper and deeper into the woods. No one was out here to help her. Her only chance was to hide.<br> <br>She smacked hard into a tree. She swayed backward, then caught herself and ducked behind the trunk, forcing her feet to still, even though her pulse was racing.<br> <br>No noise. Nothing.<br> <br>Only the whisper of wind through the branches and the wild thudding of her heart. She dug her nails into the bark as she strained to listen. She couldn&#x2019;t breathe. It felt like someone was squeezing her lungs in a big fist. She shut her eyes and tried to be utterly still as she fused herself against the tree and waited.<br> <br>In the distance, a soft rustle. She turned toward the sound and felt a swell of relief. Had she lost him?<br> <br>Please, God. Please, please, please . . .<br> <br>A faint snick behind her, and Tessa&#x2019;s heart convulsed. She hadn&#x2019;t lost him at all.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Dani Harper steered her pickup down the narrow road toward the whir of lights. She reached the clearing and pulled up beside a white van, surveying the scene through the mist. A pair of uniforms stood off to the side. Beyond a line of haphazardly parked vehicles, swags of yellow tape cordoned off a silver sedan.<br> <br>She glanced at the logo on the van and her nerves fluttered. The Delphi Center. Her boss must have called them. The lieutenant didn&#x2019;t like using outside help, but San Marcos PD didn&#x2019;t have the resources to handle a scene like this.<br> <br>Dani reached for the poncho she kept in back, then thought better of it. It would be hot as a trash bag, and she was already sweaty from her yoga class. She pushed aside the grocery sack containing the frozen dinner she wouldn&#x2019;t be eating anytime soon and grabbed a baseball cap, settling it on her head and pulling her ponytail through the back as she got out. Her cross-trainers sank into the muck.<br> <br>One of the uniforms trudged over, and Dani recognized him as he passed under the light of a portable scene lamp. Jasper Miller. Six-three, 250. He was a rookie out of Houston, barely six months on the job.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Dani.&#x201d; He smiled, catching her off guard again with those boyish dimples that seemed at odds with his huge build.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell me you didn&#x2019;t touch anything.&#x201d; She pulled a pair of gloves from the box she kept in the back of her truck.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t touch anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>She tugged the latex over her hands and took out a mini-flashlight. She picked her way across the damp grass, careful not to step on any sort of evidence.<br> <br>&#x201c;When did you get here?&#x201d; She ducked under the scene tape.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, about&#x201d;&#x2014;he checked his watch&#x2014;&#x201c;twenty minutes ago? Not long after the first responder. Old lady that lives off the highway thought she heard someone shooting off fireworks here in the park.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And them?&#x201d; She nodded at the two crime-scene technicians crouched behind the sedan, examining something. A tire impression, maybe? Whatever it was, they&#x2019;d erected a little tent over it in case it started to rain again.<br> <br>&#x201c;They showed up five minutes ago,&#x201d; Jasper said.<br> <br>The car was a late-model Honda Accord, squeaky-clean right down to the hubcaps. It must have arrived before the rain. The driver&#x2019;s-side door stood open, and Dani&#x2019;s stomach tightened with dread as she walked around the front, sidestepping a numbered evidence marker. She halted and stared.<br> <br>The victim lay sprawled in the grass. Khaki pants, button-down shirt, short haircut. He had a bullet hole just below his neck, and flies were already buzzing around it, making themselves right at home. They hovered below his belt, too, where the front of his pants was dark with blood.<br> <br>Dani felt a wave of dizziness. Then it was gone.<br> <br>She stepped closer, glancing up at the blue tarp someone had thoughtfully erected over the body. She switched on her flashlight and crouched down for a closer look. On the victim&#x2019;s left hand was a wedding ring, and Dani&#x2019;s heart squeezed.<br> <br>Some woman&#x2019;s whole world would be shattered tonight. It was shattered already&#x2014;she just didn&#x2019;t know it yet.<br> <br>She glanced up at Jasper. He looked nervous and eager for something to do.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a portable scene lamp in the back of my truck,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You mind?&#x201d;<br> <br>He trekked off, and she focused on the victim again. Given the location at this park, she&#x2019;d expected a teenager, but he looked more like an accountant. She studied his face carefully. His eyes were half-shut and wire-rimmed glasses sat crooked on his nose. A determined line of ants had already formed a trail into his mouth.<br> <br>Dani aimed her flashlight inside the vehicle.<br> <br>No wallet, no cell phone, no computer case. The wallet was likely in his pocket, but no one could touch him until the ME&#x2019;s van arrived. She skimmed her flashlight over the car&#x2019;s interior, paying close attention to the floorboards and cup holders.<br> <br>Jasper returned with the lamp and started setting up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Was this other door closed when you got here?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I told you, I didn&#x2019;t touch anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked back at the CSIs pouring quick-dry plaster into an impression on the ground. Roland Delgado glanced up at her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, there, Dani Girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey. Who else is here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Another one of your uniforms.&#x201d; Roland nodded at the trees near the lake where flashlights continued to flicker. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s combing the woods with Travis Cullen.&#x201d;<br> <br>Travis Cullen. So no Scott tonight. Dani felt a twinge of relief as she stood up.<br> <br>She leaned into the car and popped open the glove compartment. The insurance card was sitting right on top inside a protective plastic sleeve.<br> <br>She stepped away from the Accord and turned her back on the victim as she dialed Ric Santos. He answered on the first ring.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;On my way. What do we got?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;White male, thirty to forty, gunshot wound to the chest and groin, point-blank range.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Groin?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Damn. What else?&#x201d;<br> <br>A low grumble had her turning toward the road. Her nerves skittered as a gunmetal-gray Dodge pickup pulled into the clearing and glided to a stop beside the crime-scene van.<br> <br>&#x201c;No ID yet,&#x201d; she told Ric. &#x201c;But there&#x2019;s an insurance card inside the vehicle. James Matthew Ayers, 422 Clear Brook Drive.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s near the university.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a hangtag on the mirror. A university parking permit.&#x201d;<br> <br>Scott Black slid from his pickup and slammed the door. He reached into the truck bed to unlatch the shiny chrome toolbox. He pulled out his evidence kit and glanced up.<br> <br>Their gazes locked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dani?&#x201d; Ric asked.<br> <br>She turned away. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The permit. Is it A or B?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;B. Faculty parking.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your ETA?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Five minutes,&#x201d; Ric said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll probably beat the ME.&#x201d;<br> <br>She ended the call and closed her eyes briefly. Raindrops dampened her face and water trickled between her breasts. She was in yoga pants and a tank top, and she wished she&#x2019;d had time to change into something better suited for detective work because it was going to be a long night.<br> <br>She took a deep breath and made a mental list. She had to interview the first responder. And she had to get a K-9 team out here. She sent her lieutenant a text coded 911 for urgent.<br> <br>Roland and the female CSI were still crouched behind the car, and the woman was snapping pictures. She had to be the Delphi Center crime-scene photographer, but Dani had never met her.<br> <br>Scott stood beside the Accord now, his back to the victim as he skimmed his flashlight over the ground. The firearms expert was tall and broad shouldered, with the super-ripped body of a former Navy SEAL. Instead of his usual tactical pants and combat boots, he wore jeans and a leather jacket tonight, so maybe he&#x2019;d been out when he&#x2019;d gotten the call. Dani knew from experience that his jacket had nothing to do with the weather and everything to do with the Sig Sauer he carried concealed at his hip.<br> <br>Something glinted in the grass, and Scott crouched down to tag it with a numbered marker. Two minutes on the scene and already he&#x2019;d discovered a piece of evidence. He stood and squared his shoulders, and Dani felt a pang deep inside her as he approached.<br> <br>He stopped and towered over her, and for a moment they just stared at each other.<br> <br>&#x201c;Was the passenger door closed when you got here?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the girl?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No sign of her.&#x201d; Dani nodded at the woods. &#x201c;One of our officers is searching near the lake with Travis.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jasper joined them by the car. &#x201c;How do you know there&#x2019;s a girl?&#x201d;<br> <br>Scott knelt beside the body. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t come all the way out here to jerk off.&#x201d; Scott looked at Dani. &#x201c;You have an ID yet?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing confirmed.&#x201d;<br> <br>He watched her for a moment with those cool blue eyes. His gaze shifted to the woods. &#x201c;You need a K-9 team.&#x201d;<br> <br>She bristled. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br> <br>He strode over to his truck and opened the toolbox again. He took out a metal detector, which would help him locate shell casings or bullets, and maybe even the second victim if she was wearing jewelry or a belt.<br> <br>Then again, the killer might have taken her somewhere else. Dani glanced back at the road and got a queasy feeling in her stomach. Where was she?<br> <br>She turned her attention to the lake, visible just beyond the trees. It was a scenic spot, usually&#x2014;a tranquil little oasis for couples. But not tonight.<br> <br>She glanced at Scott again, and he was watching her closely&#x2014;so closely it made her wonder what he was thinking.<br> <br>&#x201c;You coming?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>She nodded at the body. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stay with him until the ME shows.&#x201d;<br> <br>Scott walked off, and Dani let her gaze follow him until he disappeared into the woods.<br> <br>The medical examiner&#x2019;s van rolled up, followed closely by Ric, and Dani&#x2019;s stomach tightened as she thought of everything she didn&#x2019;t like about this case. And it wasn&#x2019;t even an hour old yet.<br> <br>Ric walked over, his expression grim as he took in the scene. &#x201c;The media has it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That didn&#x2019;t take long.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was all over the scanner,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;I give us ten minutes, tops, before they roll in here with their cameras. We need to barricade the road.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Daniele.&#x201d;<br> <br>She turned toward the sound of Scott&#x2019;s deep voice calling her from the woods. He was a tall silhouette at the edge of the trees, and from his tone Dani knew it was bad.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; she yelled back.<br> <br>&#x201c;I found her.&#x201d;</p><h2>Butterfly: From Refugee to Olympian - My Story of Rescue, Hope, and Triumph</h2><p><p>The inspiring story of how one woman saved fellow refugees from drowning&#x2015;and how she went on to become an Olympic swimmer.</p><p>When young Syrian refugee Yusra Mardini realized her boat's engine shut down as she was traveling from Syria to Greece with other refugees, there was no hesitation: she dove into the water. Surfacing, she heard desperate prayers and sobbing from the passengers in the sinking boat above her. Between the waves, her elder sister Sarah screamed at her to get back on the boat. But Mardini was determined. She was not going to let Sarah do this alone. Grabbing the rope with one hand, she began kicking up the black water, inching the boat towards the distant shore.</p><p>This bold act of bravery saved the lives of a boatload of refugees heading to Turkey from Syria. After her arrival in Greece, Mardini, focused and undeterred, worked toward a lifelong goal: to compete in the Olympics. She succeeded, and competed in 2016 on the Refugee Olympic Team in Rio de Janeiro. </p><p><i>Butterfly</i> tells her story, from Syria to the Olympics to her current work with the UN as a Goodwill Ambassador.

Recounts the dramatic true story of the Discalced Carmelite nuns of Compiegne, martyred during the French Revolution&#39;s &#39;Great Terror&#39; and known to the world through their fictional representation in Gertrud von Le Fort&#39;s Song at the Scaffold and Francis Poulenc&#39;s Dialogues of the Carmelites. Includes index and 15 photos. At the height of the French Revolution&#39;s &#39;Great Terror&#39; a community of sixteen Carmelite nuns from Compiegne offered their lives to restore peace to the church and to France. Ten days after their deaths by the guillotine, Robespierre fell, and with his exectuion on the same scaffold the Reign of Terror effectively ended. Had God thus accepted and used the Carmelites&#39; generous self-gift? Through Gertrud von Le Fort&#39;s modern novella, Song at the Scaffold, and Francis Poulenc&#39;s famed opera, Dialogues of the Carmelites, (with its libretto by Georges Bernanos), modern audiences around the world have become captivated by the mysterious destiny of these Compiegne martyrs, Blessed Teresa of St. Augustine and her companions. Now, for the first time in English, William Bush explores at length the facts behind the fictional representations, and reflects on their spiritual significance. Based on years of research, this book recounts in lively detail virtually all that is known of the life and background of each of the martyrs, as well as the troubled times in which they lived. The Compiegne Carmelites, sustained by their remarkable prioress, emerge as distinct individuals, struggling as Christians to understand and respond to an awesome calling, relying not on their own strength but on the mercy of God and the guiding hand of Providence.</p><p></p><h2>The Dollmaker (Forgotten Files, 2)</h2><p><p>Dr. Tessa McGowan had never seen anything quite like it.

D&amp;C 19:10 ... So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast a seed into the ground; And should sleep, ... and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. Mark 4:26-27 We believe many things but don't always know how to implement them. We believe that human beings can grow into Gods; we accept the importance of coming to Christ and also of awakening our divine attributes and powers -- but how to do that seems obscure. Likely a list of spiritual to-do's ceases to serve. So we may find ourselves seeking a more fulfilling path -- but where to set our foot? In recent years, studies in adult developmental psychology have cast unexpected light on the path to Godhood. They illustrate that human beings already possess the potent seeds for unfolding into more highly developed beings. We learn that spiritual practices can shape the mind into and instrument for facilitating spiritual growth and experience, that is, for continuing from "grace to grace." Along the way, venturing into the unknown, we shed false concepts about ourselves, about our reality, and about God Himself. The purpose of this book is to explore the path of spiritual development.</p><p></p><h2>On Suicide (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>The landmark investigation into suicide and society?now in a new translation</b> <br><br> �mile Durkheim, one of the fathers of modern sociology, was the first to suggest that suicide might be as much a response to society as an act of individual despair. When he looked at social, religious, or racial groups that had high incidences of suicide, he discovered that abnormally high or low levels of social integration increase the likelihood of suicide. More than a century after its initial publication, Durkheim?s groundbreaking work continues to fascinate and challenge those seeking to understand one of the least understandable of human acts.</p><p>Robin Buss is a writer and translator who works for the<i><b>Independent on Sunday</b></i> and as television critic for The <b>Times Educational Supplement</b>.

The March winds whipped against the pickup as she hurried toward Twin Canyons Ranch, thirty-four miles south of Promise, Texas.<br><br>Her mother-in-law was with the children, but Jeremy and Emma would have difficulty getting the animals into the barn without help. Ruth would do what she could, but the older woman's heart wasn't strong and... Nell didn't want to think what might happen if she didn't make it back in time.<br><br>Her life had been on a fast-moving treadmill for the past three years, ever since her husband died in a tractor accident. Storms were the least of her worries, considering the financial challenges she'd faced working the ranch without Jake. Not a day passed that her husband wasn't in her thoughts. Twenty years from now, <em>forty</em> years from now, he'd still be a part of her.<br><br>Ruth and others had encouraged her to remarry, at least to date, but Nell had resisted. She never expected to love again&#x2014;not the way she loved Jake. Their love was the kind that happened only once in a lifetime, and no other man could compare to her Jake.<br><br>Nell had always known she wasn't any candidate for homecoming queen, but Jake had made her feel like one. He'd understood what it was to be big-boned and just plain big. Dainty or elegant would never describe her; at six feet, Nell was as tall as most men. Jake had been six feet four inches by the time he was a high-school freshman, and the only boy in school taller than Nell.<br><br>They'd lived in the same town all their lives, but it wasn't until high school that she'd noticed him. The very first day of high school, as a matter of fact. She was a freshman to his senior, and the minute his eyes met hers as she walked down the hall, she knew she'd found her life's mate. He was the only boy she'd ever dated. When he enlisted in the army and became an Airborne Ranger, she'd written him every day. He served his time in the army and was discharged a week after her graduation. Despite her family's protests, she'd married Jake while still a teenager.<br><br>Neither was to know that ten years was all the time they'd have together. It was Nell who'd found her husband trapped beneath the tractor, Nell who'd held him in her arms as the life flowed out of him, Nell who'd screamed in anguish, helpless to do anything to save her husband's life.<br><br>Now it was Nell who struggled to hold on to Twin Canyons Ranch, tended what remained of the herd, raised their children and cared for Jake's aging mother. The ranch had been Jake's dream&#x2014;and hers; it was a small spread that they'd bought together, shortly after their marriage. But she was so very tired, weary to the bone with her financial struggles and other worries. The past three years had drained her mentally, emotionally and physically. For that reason she'd sold off most of the herd and started a new venture. A dude ranch.<br><br>Bless Jeremy's heart. Her son had been the one to give her the idea. Last year, she'd promised him a reward for acing his spelling test and he'd chosen to rent a movie. Of all the movies available, he'd picked <em>City Slickers,</em> and to Nell it was like a revelation.<br><br>After seeing the movie, Nell hadn't been able to sleep all night. She was certainly familiar with dude ranches, but it had never occurred to her that this might be a solution to her own dilemma. She couldn't say she understood it, but people actually paid for the opportunity to eat food cooked in a chuck wagon, ride around on horses and drive cattle. Why these people would prefer to live in primitive circumstances when they could experience the luxury of some fancy resort for basically the same price was beyond her. Apparently she had a lot to learn&#x2014;but learn she did. After months of research Nell was convinced that a dude ranch really was the answer. With a portion of her profits from the sale of last year's herd, she'd had brochures printed and she'd contacted several travel companies. Now she was almost ready for business, and in a couple of months she'd be entertaining her first bunkhouse full of greenhorns.<br><br>In many ways she was a natural for this kind of work. After these few years without Jake, there wasn't a ranching chore she couldn't accomplish with the speed and dexterity of a man. At this point, she knew as much about ranching as any cowboy. Not only that, she'd heard the great stories of Texas all her life&#x2014;stories about the state's settlement and the Alamo and the early cattle drives and many more. She'd always loved those stories, and if she could make money telling them now, romanticizing the Old West, all the better.<br><br>Heavy black clouds darkened the sky. Pushing thoughts of Jake from her mind, Nell focused her attention on the highway. Driving well above the speed limit, she rounded a turn in the road and saw a sports utility vehicle parked along the side.<br><br>Some damn fool had stopped to take pictures of the approaching storm. The man obviously wasn't a local. Anyone from Texas would know to take cover, and fast. Like the state of Texas itself, storms tended to make an impression, especially spring storms like this one.<br><br>Despite her hurry, Nell applied her brakes and pulled over. With the engine running, she leaped down from the cab. The wind slapped her long braid against her face as she raced toward the stranger.<br><br>The greenhorn lowered his camera. "Howdy," he greeted her cheerfully. He was taller than she was and clean-cut. His clothes were new-looking but rumpled.<br><br>"Listen, I don't mean to be rude, but any idiot knows to head for cover in a storm."<br><br>His smile faded to a frown.<br><br>"I don't know where you're from or where you're going," she went on, "but if I were you I'd get my butt back into that fancy car of yours and drive into town as fast as those tires will take you." Having done her duty, she started back to her truck.<br><br>"Hey," he said, "Got a minute? I have a few questions."<br><br>"I have to go." Nell didn't mean to sound abrupt, but she didn't have time to waste. She'd said her piece and whether or not he took her advice was completely up to him.<br><br>"Are you from around the area?" he called after her.<br><br>"Yes! Now listen, we get hail the size of golf balls and if you don't want to pay to have the dents removed, then I suggest you make tracks for town."<br><br>"This will only take a minute..."<br><br>"I don't <em>have</em> a minute, I've got horses and calves to worry about," Nell shouted into the wind. "And I don't have time to convince you a storm is about to break." She raised her hand toward the threatening sky. "It's going to cost you plenty if you don't get that vehicle under cover."<br><br>"I'm insured."<br><br>"Hail is an act of God." Whether he caught her last words or not she didn't know. Nell leaped into her truck and put the pickup in gear. One glance in the rear-view mirror proved that giving this stranger advice had been a wasted effort. He hadn't moved. Furthermore, he wasn't snapping pictures of the dark horizon anymore; he was taking pictures of her!<br><br>Shaking her head in wonder, Nell dismissed him from her thoughts, and drove home at breakneck speed.<br><br>When she pulled into the ranch yard, she saw Jeremy chasing chickens in a futile attempt to lure them into the coop. Emma and Ruth led the horses toward the barn, yanking on the reins as the two geldings battled the wind. The scene right before the tornado in <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> flashed through Nell's mind.<br><br>She parked the truck near the barn, where it would be protected, and hurried toward her family. With her help, Ruth and Emma managed to secure the animals before the storm broke.<br><br>By the time they scurried into the house, the rain had started and they were breathless and excited.<br><br>"We did it!" Twelve-year-old Jeremy said, exchanging a high five with his sister. Unlike most siblings, Jeremy and Emma rarely fought. Sure, they squabbled now and then&#x2014;all kids did&#x2014;but these two were close in age and temperament. They'd also been through the devastating experience of their father's death, which had created a strong bond between them.<br><br>Jeremy was large for his age, like his father and Nell, too&#x2014;big-boned, muscular and tall. Two years younger, Emma was small and delicate, resembling Ruth, her grandmother.<br><br>"I'm glad you made it home in time," Ruth said, pouring Nell a cup of hot tea before filling a second cup for herself.<br><br>Nell gazed out the kitchen window at the ferocity of the storm. The wind propelled the rain at an almost horizontal angle, pelting the trees and flowers. Smaller trees were bent nearly in half. Many a new crop would see ruin this afternoon.<br><br>Sighing, she turned away from the window. "I would have been a couple of minutes earlier if it hadn't been for some greenhorn," she said. "The silly fool stopped at the side of the road to take pictures."<br><br>"Anyone you recognized?" Ruth asked.<br><br>"Never saw him before in my life." Nell would have remembered him if she had. He was big like Jake, sturdy and broad-shouldered. Unfortunately&#x2014;unlike Jake&#x2014;he didn't seem to possess an ounce of common sense.<br><br>Ruth shook her head. "Probably one of those tornado chasers."<br><br>Nell frowned. "I don't think so." He wasn't the type. Too soft, she decided, and although it might sound unkind, not all that bright. Anyone with brains knew to seek shelter in a storm.<br><br>"What's for dinner?" Jeremy asked.<br><br>"Not chili," Emma pleaded.<br><br>Despite herself Nell laughed. "Not chili," she assured her. Her family had been good sports, sampling different variations of her chili recipe for the past few months. Nell was perfecting her recipe and had used her family as taste-testers.<br><br>The Chili Cook-off was being held that weekend as part of the Promise Rodeo. These festivities launched spring the way the big Cattlemen's Association dance in June signaled the beginning of summer.<br><br>Nell held high hopes that her chili might actually win this year. Her talents in the kitchen were legendary, and she believed she made a great pot of chili. For weeks she'd been combining recipes, adding this, subtracting that. After feeding her family chili twice a week, she was finally satisfied with her recipe.<br><br>"Are you going to win the cook-off?" Emma asked.<br><br>"Of course she is," Ruth answered before Nell could respond. "I don't see why she shouldn't, seeing she's the best cook this side of the Rio Grande."<br><br>Both children nodded enthusiastically, and Nell smiled. "How about porcupine meatballs for dinner?" she suggested. The meatballs, made with rice and cooked in tomato soup, were one of the children's favorites. Jeremy and Emma instantly agreed.<br><br>"I'll peel the potatoes," Ruth said. As usual her mother-in-law was willing to lend a hand.<br><br>The lights flickered just then, and the house went dark.<br><br>"That's okay," Jeremy said. "We don't need electricity. We can roast weenies in the fireplace, can't we?"<br><br>"Yeah," Emma seconded. "We could have hot dogs."<br><br>"Sounds like a good idea to me." Nell reached for a candle, grateful her children maintained a sense of adventure. They were going to need it when the first dude ranch guests arrived.<br><br>Cal Patterson shook the moisture from his jacket as he stepped inside out of the driving rain. He removed his Stetson and placed it on the hook just inside the porch to dry. He'd done what he could to protect his herd, gotten his horses into the barn and battened down the shutters where he could. Glen, his brother and business partner, had left for town early in hopes of beating the storm. Cal had worked alone, listening with half an ear for his wife's arrival. He didn't like the idea of Jane driving all the way from town in this kind of weather.<br><br>"Cal, is that you?"<br><br>His heart rate accelerated at the sound of her voice. "Jane? What the hell are you doing here? Where's your car? I didn't see it."<br><br>"I live here, remember?" she teased, joining him in the kitchen porch while he removed his boots. She'd obviously just had a bath and now wore a flannel bathrobe, belted loosely about her waist. "And I didn't park in my usual place because Glen's truck was still there."<br><br>"You should've stayed in town," he chastised, but he was delighted she'd managed to make it home. He didn't relish the idea of a night spent without her. Two months of marriage, and he'd grown accustomed to sharing his home and his heart with this woman.<br><br>"The clinic closed early," she informed him, "and I've got my beeper. Anyone can reach me in case of a medical emergency."<br><br>Cal shed his jacket and slipped his arms around her waist, pulling her close and urging her into the kitchen. His wife was the town's only physician, so there were constant demands on her time. "I don't know if I'll ever be able to stop worrying about you."<br><br>"Hey, I'm a big girl."<br><br>"Sure you are!" He was about to kiss her when the lights went out. Not that he minded. A romantic interlude wasn't unwelcome.<br><br>"I've got a fire going in the fireplace," she whispered, pressing against him, reminding him of the benefits of married life. She looped her arms around his neck and kissed his jaw.<br><br>Cal shut his eyes and inhaled her fresh sweet scent. This was about as close to heaven as he expected to get in his lifetime. "I don't suppose you're wearing that see-through nightie of yours?"<br><br>"No," she said, "but that could be arranged."<br><br>"Now you're talkin'."<br><br>Cal felt her smile against his skin. "I love you, Rebel."<br><br>Growling, he swung her into his arms and carried her into the living room. Sure enough, a small fire flickered in the fireplace. This had become their favorite room; he'd lost count of the number of times they'd made love in front of the fireplace. The room had a special significance for him, since it was here that he'd first realized how much he'd come to care about her. It was here in this very room that Dr. Texas, as he was fond of calling her, had taken his freeze-dried heart and breathed life into his lonely existence.<br><br>Cal was happier than he'd ever thought possible. With each passing day he loved Jane more. Their love had demanded plenty of adjustments on both sides. Sacrifices. But for everything he'd given up, he'd gained so much more.<br><br>The storm raged outside and a fair one was building on the living-room carpet when Jane's beeper went off.<br><br>Cal groaned and rolled onto his back, inhaling several deep breaths. "That damn well better be important," he muttered.<br><br>"Cal!"<br><br>"I want someone <em>real</em> sick."<br><br>Giggling, Jane scrambled for her beeper and read the message. "It's Laredo Smith," she said.<br><br>"Wanna bet he's phoning about Savannah?"<br><br>"She's just over eight months," Jane said, sounding concerned.<br><br>"But Laredo's acting like she's three weeks overdue."<br><br>"He's worried, that's all."<br><br>Cal figured he would be, too, in Laredo's situation. This was the Smiths' first child, and Savannah was over thirty; as well, Cal knew there'd been some minor complications with the pregnancy. Despite that&#x2014;and unlike her husband&#x2014;the mother-to-be remained calm and confident. Savannah had insisted on a home delivery, overriding Laredo's protests.<br><br>"This shouldn't take long," Jane promised. She hurried over to the hall phone.<br><br>Cal cupped his hands behind his head and watched his wife move through the room, bathed in firelight. Her hair was mussed and her bathrobe hastily tied&#x2014;and he couldn't recall a time she'd looked more beautiful. It never ceased to amaze him that Jane had agreed to be his wife.<br><br></p><h2>Collected Poems, 1948-1984</h2><p><p>This remarkable collection, which won the 1986 <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize for Poetry, includes most of the poems from each of Derek Walcott's seven prior books of verse and all of his long autobiographical poem, "Another Life." The 1992 Nobel Laureate in Literature, Walcott has been producing--for several decades--a poetry with all the beauty, wisdom, directness, and narrative force of our classic myths and fairy tales, and in this hefty volume readers will find a full record of his important endeavor. "Walcott's virutes as a poet are extraordinary," James Dickey wrote in <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>. "He could turn his attention on anything at all and make it live with a reality beyond its own; through his fearless language it becomes not only its acquired life, but the real one, the one that lasts . . . Walcott is spontaneous, headlong, and inventive beyond the limits of most other poets now writing."</p></p><p><b>Derek Walcott (1930-2017)</b> was born in St. Lucia, the West Indies, in 1930. His <i>Collected Poems: 1948-1984</i> was published in 1986, and his subsequent works include a book-length poem, <i>Omeros </i>(1990); a collection of verse, <i>The Bounty</i> (1997); and, in an edition illustrated with his own paintings, the long poem <i>Tiepolo's Hound</i> (2000). His numerous plays include <i>The Haitian Trilogy</i> (2001) and <i>Walker and The Ghost Dance</i> (2002). Walcott received the Queen's Medal for Poetry in 1988 and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992.<p>&#x201c;One of the most instructive experiences afforded by this collected edition is the spectacle of a poet moving with gradually deepening confidence to found his own poetic domain, independent of the tradition he inherited yet not altogether orphaned from it . . . This is a triumphant book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Seamus Heaney, The Boston Globe</i></p><p>&#x201c;It is difficult to think of a poet in our century who--without ever betraying his native sources--has so organically assimilated the evolution of English literature from the Renaissance to the present, who has absorbed the Classical and Judeo-Christian past, and who has mined the history of Western painting as Walcott has. Throughout his entire body of work he has managed to hold in balance his passionate moral concerns with the ideal of art. By his fifty-fifth year Derek Walcott has made his culture, history, and sociology into a myth for our age and into an epic song that has already taken its place in the history of Western literature.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Peter Balakian, Poetry</i></p></p><h2>Engage: A Theological Field Education Toolkit (Volume 1) (Explorations in Theological Field Education, 1)</h2><p>Theological field education, in which a ministry student steps out of the classroom and begins practicing with the supervision of a mentor, is a critical part of accredited ministry programs. Engage equips both students and their supervisor-mentors to engage in this important opportunity with energy and imagination, and it prepares students for the challenging work of integrating theory into real-world practice.<br><br>Engage provides coaching from recognized experts in the arts of ministry: preaching, administration, evangelism, pastoral care, public ministry, leadership, faith formation, liturgical arts and more. Other chapters address themes such as race, gender, and ministry across faith traditions (or no faith tradition). The book addresses field education in a range of contexts&#x2014;from churches to non-profits.<br><br>Engage offers a valuable resource for students making the most of their transition from the classroom into real world ministry with all its joys and many challenges.</p><p>Matthew Floding is director of ministerial formation at Duke Divinity School. He previously served as director of formation for ministry at Western Theological Seminary. He has also served as pastor and college chaplain and is a consultant with expertise in field education issues. He is a former chair of the Association for Theological Field Education and editor of Welcome to Theological Field Education.Academic instruction, identity formation, skill building, contextual analysis and intervention intersect with the questions of what is God doing today - among the people and in my growth toward ministry. Engage provides a compass for individual and congregational development in these areas and multiple maps for navigating the bumps, twists, and smoother places where learning, service, and reflection intersect. During the nineteen years that I served as a seminary director of field education I wish I had this book to help guide students and supervisors as they navigated congregations and other ministry settings.... Overall, Matthew Floding has chosen experienced practitioners and skilled reflectors to assemble his toolkit. The editing intentionally allows the multiple voices to complement each other.... It would be my choice today for a solid introduction to students and supervisors beginning the adventure of supervised ministry. (<i>Anglican Theological Review</i>)<br><br>Once again, Floding shows us why he is a national expert in the area of theological field education. He has assembled an all-star cast of authors across denominational lines to equip both those preparing for ministry and those shepherding future ministers. Theological field education takes the classroom and integrates it into the real world of ministry, making education truly come alive. Engage is one of the most well-rounded, complete resources I have seen for ministry preparation. (George M. Hillman, Jr., Dallas Theological Seminary)<br><br>Research has shown that the lecture is out, and hands-on experiential learning is in. This fantastic book not only offers a wide range of angles on formation for faith leaders, but it also pushes them to engage in making their learning as dynamic and creative as possible. No student should prepare for ministry leadership without this outstanding toolbox of a book in their pocket. (Christian Scharen, Auburn Theological Seminary)<br><br>Engage is a valuable advice manual and resource guide for seminary students learning to live and serve in actual, real-life congregations and other ministry settings for the first time. Experienced pastors and thoughtful theological educators offer helpful guidance on many important aspects of learning and doing ministry. Dive in wherever your interests and concerns take you. You'll find thoughtful, practical advice as well as helpful suggestions for further reading. (Craig Dykstra, Duke Divinity School)<br><br>It's like we have an extra instructor in the classroom.

Wildwitchery is all about a weaving of celebration, invocation, visualisation, and our heartfelt intent into our familiar practices We weave while respecting and recognising the spirit inherent in each part of creation and the ebb and flow of the seasons. The wildness gives our practice an unpredictable element, making sure we are ready even in the midst of the most tedious aspects of life, like doing the laundry or cleaning, to interact with our surroundings magically. When we work magic we weave the wild energy of everything from seasonal energy to spirit energy into our everyday deeds. It is this ongoing work that results in our life of natural enchantment. The "witchyness" comes into the equation by means of our starlight vision-our ability and will to perceive these energies-which allows us to understand and connect with all that is considered to be mysterious and hidden. The word "craft" used in wild witchcraft is about intentionally translating that magical spark into grounded and ordinary tasks, consciously bringing enchantment into our household chores, childcare, handiwork, relationships, and leisure pursuits. Our craft ensures that we have the skill&#x2015;that we know how magic works and have a familiarity with safe procedures&#x2015;and the knowledge&#x2015;particularly of energetic influences, spiritual attributes, and seasonal meanings&#x2015;we need for the work we will be doing. It is true that spellcraft can be practised under a full moon in robes but it can also be worked whilst baking bread, shelling peas, watering plants, combing hair, or painting a room. A wildwitch can create formal spells in a controlled way but chooses to do so not as an isolated, occasional act but as a part of an integrated magical life in which every thought or deed can become an act of devotion or enchantment. The key is to see the potential for each moment to be magical and each act to be a sacred experience. With complete commitment, awareness, and a sense of fulfilling a vital role in our modern world, a wildwitch's whole life can become an unfolding, ongoing spirit song of dedication to healing, harmony, and wholeness. Wild witchcraft is, therefore, not only something that we practice when the occasion calls for it but something that we live from minute to minute. Because of this, there are no ordinary, dull moments, only a seamless flow, a merging of magic into life.</p> <p><strong>Maintain Balance</strong> <br>Wild witchcraft is a balance of Earthly (manifest) appreciation and spiritual (ethereal) understanding; an interaction that is both simple and effective. We are all souls that need to develop and grow, but we are also humans that need to find meaning in life. If we are interested in the wild craft we should first consider if our souls are energetically compatible with a path that empowers through a love for the Earth and that works with the waxing and waning tides of life for magical, healing purposes. This is but one of many ways to walk toward truth. The wild way will resonate profoundly with us if we are willing to commit to a process that not only strengthens and nurtures us as spiritual beings but also gives us an opportunity to act for the environment and our fellow creatures in an active, physical sense. It is a way to live well.</p> <p>It is important that we can feel comfortable with the idea that this balance exists in the outside world and is found within us; we are a balance of the eternal and the corporeal. Even though the corporeal seems more solid at this moment, it is actually the more transient of the two expressions; souls last beyond a lifetime whereas bodies do not! For wildwitches, there can be no separation between ourselves and the rest of creation; likewise, there can be no separation between the inner and outer expression of a wildwitch's own self. One always affects the other. Consequently, we will work from the perspective of the interconnectedness of all creation, with ourselves as valuable (although not superior) parts of it. To acknowledge the life force in ourselves and all fellow beings on a daily basis is known as an Earth-honouring green spirituality.</p> <p>What we know to be physical and what we understand to be spiritual is the basis to spellweaving, green spirituality, and wild witchery. We respect the differences between the physical and the spiritual levels of existence while realising that they cannot be separated and defined in a black and white sense; they are interwoven, interdependent aspects of being. Our lives can glow with the interplay of fixed and mutable energies, the solid and ethereal realities that make up the weft and warp of the wholeness of existence. Our role as wildwitches is to weave the thread back and forth between the levels of being for the purpose of magical transformation and to note the patterns, textures, and hues that reveal themselves to us in this process.</p> <p><strong>Earthwalk</strong> <br>We may find that the role of the wildwitch and our own nature are interlinked, entwined and bound by promises made long ago or by understandings gained in the time before time. With this possibility, we are acknowledging our existence as both a temporal and temporary human being and as an eternal spiritual essence finding human expression. Consequently, it may seem entirely natural to weave magical understanding into the very fabric of our daily existence, to become an enchanter or enchantress, and to see ourselves as actively being enchantment. Indeed, our wild craft requires such commitment. By applying such dedication we will be putting both human heart and eternal soul into our wild craft for the duration of this incarnate life. And, perhaps, beyond.</p> <p>We shall refer to the duration of our present incarnation as the "Earthwalk." When balancing the manifest and ethereal, it is important to end the separation between human existence on this planet and our generous host, Earth Mother. Our Earthwalk suggests a specific partnership, a relationship between manifest beings and Earth, which is a complex living organism that chooses to support the continued existence of all physical beings. The whole ethos of walking as a wildwitch revolves around this end to apartness; it is vital that we state both verbally and symbolically, as often as we can, without contrivance, how we honour our connection to the planet Earth.</p> <p><strong>Seeing and Knowing</strong> <br>In order to truly lead a balanced way we must awaken our starlight vision, which we briefly mentioned in the introduction. To do this, we must combine intuiting and feeling (sensing the ethereal) with education and hands-on doing (practical, manifest application). Once again, to sense the ethereal is "seeing" and to understand the ethereal is "knowing." Therefore we could say that, as wildwitches, we continually exercise the seeing, the knowing, and the physical magical practices we learn by studying the wild craft. The physical magical practices include working with healing herbs, utilising symbolic objects, and practising divination with specific tools. It is important to remember that there should always be an appreciation of both the physical presence and the unseen resonance of all that we do. One such way wildwitches work in perfect balance with the seen and unseen is by making the divisions between the nebulous and the solid less clear. We can do this by working with pure sound, scent, and colour in our magic, or by using word sounds and patterns in chant. The most common of these methods is daily enchantment. Wild enchantment relies on spoken affirmation and repetitive rhyme, hence the "chant" in enchantment, meaning to use verbal incantation for magical purposes. We may also use simple statements for affirmation of our intent at any given stage during our wild witchcraft. Throughout this book there will be adages in quotations that may help us to focus on and reaffirm our more general and universal intent as wildwitches. The first of these sums up what we have talked about above: "We mend, tend, and blend."</p> <p>Our desire to blend the realms of existence, both the widely considered "seen" (manifest) and intentionally or inadvertently "unseen" (ethereal/spiritual), ever closer together is for the good of our own magical development, but will ultimately ripple out to benefit the whole of creation, bringing greater balance and harmony into daily life. In other words, as we know ourselves to be living representatives of the natural way&#x2015;holding within us the same flame of life force that animates the birds and the rivers, the distant star and the grain of sand, the millionaire and the beggar-we understand that whatever we do to ourselves applies to all of creation by direct association. We know that we can no longer see pollution or destruction as "externals" because they may be caused by us. By healing our own ailments through inner work and magical practice, we can reflect this rebalancing and healing outward and onward. The maxim "As within, so without" is relevant here as it means that what we find to be true and valid within the microcosm of our own lives is inevitably reflected as a universal principle, and vice versa, with beautiful simple symmetry.</p> <p>Also, what wildwitches acknowledge to be authentic and valid in a spiritual sense becomes reality in the manifest levels, each aspect feeds the other. By having heartfelt faith in the connection between our own self and the universal whole of creation, we draw the two aspects ever closer into balance. This is the basis of wild magic. Our acts of faith, which sparkle with raw elemental energy, are woven into the tides of life and the seasons of the natural world. We blend our seeing with the knowledge of what we must physically do and then all of our spells and prayers are focused with this understanding as a basis. When we have faith in our truth-when we feel it and give it our energy, and use our practical knowledge and skill to enhance it&#x2015;then it becomes a truth in the world. Just as the preparation and cooking of a soup can be dedicated to our work and infused with intent, so can we act simply and focus powerfully to bring about positive change in a myriad of other creative ways.</p> <p><strong>For the Good of the All</strong><br>Acknowledging the wildwitch's ability to bring about manifest magical change is a liberating experience but also a responsibility to be taken very seriously as it could easily be misused. "For the good of the All" (the "All" being all encompassing, all that is) must always be our primary motivation. In a spiritual way with no absolutes in terms of tenets, this one heartfelt plea serves as an inspirational principle to work by. To understand what may be for the good of the All, we always need to first consult with our companion spirits in a safe astral place. We will discuss companions and astral place in detail later. For now, it is important to know that our companion spirits can give us "the overview" (the bigger picture or wider perspective of existence). This allows us to look beyond our own human dilemmas and enables us to witness the interconnectedness of all that is seen and unseen. It is a gift bestowed on us by the spirits so that we may see how our actions affect the whole and how the whole affects us. In our own search, we also aim to one day see all of humanity look beyond to the &gt;interconnectedness that currently awaits recognition.</p> <p>To many witches this honourable aspiration is revealed in a popular maxim: "And it harm none." There is something to be said about this phrase. Although its intentions are perfectly valid, it is sometimes inevitable that someone will consider themselves hurt in the process of change that is for a greater good. The whole ethos is never to deliberately hurt anyone or anything, but it is realistic to acknowledge that to work for the highest benefit of creation we must sometimes put a few noses out of joint. It must be understood that we never would do this with a malicious intent. It is perfectly possible that an oil company could consider itself hard done by if we all switched to using bicycles and woodburning stoves tomorrow, yet our intention would be to help Mother Earth, not to harm the individuals of the company. As we are all connected, some repercussions may be considered inescapable.</p> <p>Perhaps it is more appropriate to think of an environmental adage: "Think globally, act locally." With this in mind, we can specifically acknowledge how we can effect change in the wider world with our homespun gifts of green magic. It all begins with us and our small yet potent gestures; the stronger our belief in our connection to the All, the more we are able to influence it. This faith in the interconnectedness of all that is seen and unseen also strengthens us. How can we not be strong? We are directly linked to the same life force of vast and enigmatic planets, cascading waterfalls, and lions bringing down their prey on sun-baked savannahs. We acknowledge elemental power and therefore acknowledge the power within our own wild self.</p> <p>Because of our deep personal understanding and experience of the interconnectedness of all life, the harder it becomes for us to separate out our witch time&#x2015;the time we put aside for inner work, spellweaving, or divination&#x2015;from the rest of daily existence. The holistic viewpoint attained in wild witchcraft makes it nigh on impossible to act as someone who compartmentalises their life into "witchy" and "nonwitchy" activity. Unless we weave our beliefs and creative magic into all that we do, we are not living well, nor are we walking our truth as wildwitches. In other words, wild witchcraft is not just something that we do but something that we are. The wild way gives us the insight and ability to weave spells by wish and will, with love and care.</p> <p><strong>The Greening</strong><br>The wild way also offers an opportunity for us to work as otherworldly emissaries. Our craft prepares us to go out on a limb to bring the beauty and inspiration of the unseen levels long since hidden from the majority of human eyes into manifest existence. If we are prepared to take the first steps on the wild path, then we need to be committed to this idea that the "lost" worlds, the enchanted realms that once were much closer to the human experience, can be brought back into our level of perception. We are speaking here of the lost worlds of Faery. Reweaving the shining magic of the Faery folk (Fey) into our own more basic mode of operation is a life's work. We may see little reward in terms of money or kudos for this work but it will generate untold wealth and satisfaction. Our work will enrich and empower us on far deeper levels than financial gain or social praise. Like all ways of the wild craft, reweaving Fey magic is a daily experience. Even though it is a life's work, it cannot just be referred to on high days and holidays. It gives definition and form to all our days and colours our experience of the world.</p> <p>On a wildwitch's path this work is the "Greening," meaning to bring magic back to life with the energy of verdant resurgence, which may be found in the Fey or unseen realms. Even though these realms are hidden from the sight of most mortals, the wildwitch can experience them safely as an intermediary between them and the far denser realm that we inhabit from day to day. We may journey in a trance state to these realms and bring to light the enchantments found in our otherworldly interactions, reintroducing the glorious magics of mythic folktales into the modern world.

In this book, based on a series of his lectures, the eminent Jungian analyst and writer Edward F. Edinger revisits all the major figures, myths, oracles, and legends of the ancient Greek religion to discover what they can still reveal&#x2014;representing, as they do, one of the religious and mythic foundations of Western culture. Building on C. G. Jung's assertion that mythology is an expression of the deepest layers of mind and soul, Dr. Edinger follows the mythic images into their persistent manifestations in literature and on into our modern lives. He finds that the gods indeed continue to speak as we grow in our capacity to listen and that the myths express the inner energies within all of us as much as ever. Heracles is eternally performing his labors, Perseus is still confronting Medusa, Theseus is forever stalking the Minotaur, and Persephone is still being carried off to life in a new realm.</p><p>Edward F. Edinger, M.D., a founding member of the C. G. Jung Foundation for Analytical Psychology in New York, is the author of many books on Jungian psychology, including <i>The Eternal Drama </i> and <i>Anatomy of the Psyche: Alchemical Symbolism in Psychotherapy. </i>"A compelling answer to fundamental questions about why and how we should read myths. . . .

Ester Goldberg was a rebel from Bialystok, Poland, where virtually the entire Jewish community would be sent to Hitler&#x2019;s concentration camps. Ruzya Solodovnik was a Russian-born intellectual who would become a high-level censor under Stalin&#x2019;s regime. At war&#x2019;s end, both women found themselves in Moscow. Over the years each woman had to find her way in a country that aimed to make every citizen a cog in the wheel of murder and repression. One became a hero in her children&#x2019;s and grandchildren&#x2019;s eyes; the other became a collaborator. With grace, candor, and meticulous research, Masha Gessen, one of the most trenchant observers of Russia and its history today, peels back the layers of time to reveal her grandmothers&#x2019; lives&#x2014;and to show that neither story is quite what it seems.<br><br><b>Praise for Masha Gessen</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One of the most important activists and journalists Russia has known in a generation.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;David Remnick, <i>The New Yorker</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Masha Gessen is humbly erudite, deftly unconventional, and courageously honest.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Timothy Snyder, author of <i>On Tyranny</i></b></p><p>In the 1930s, as waves of war and persecution were crashing over Europe, two young Jewish women began separate journeys of survival. One, a Polish-born woman from Bialystok, where virtually the entire Jewish community would soon be sent to the ghetto and from there to Hitler's concentration camps, was determined not only to live but to live with pride and defiance. The other, a Russian-born intellectual and introvert, would eventually become a high-level censor under Stalin's regime. At war's end, both women found themselves in Moscow, where informers lurked on every corner and anti-Semitism reigned. It was there that Ester and Ruzya would first cross paths, there that they became the closest of friends and learned to trust each other with their lives. <br>In this deeply moving family memoir, journalist Masha Gessen tells the story of her two beloved grandmothers: Ester, the quicksilver rebel who continually battled the forces of tyranny; Ruzya, a single mother who joined the Communist Party under duress and made the compromises the regime exacted of all its citizens. Both lost their first loves in the war. Both suffered unhappy unions. Both were gifted linguists who made their living as translators. And both had children--Ester a boy, and Ruzya a girl--who would grow up, fall in love, and have two children of their own: Masha and her younger brother. <br>With grace, candor, and meticulous research, Gessen peels back the layers of secrecy surrounding her grandmothers' lives. As she follows them through this remarkable period in history--from the Stalin purges to the Holocaust, from the rise of Zionism to the fall of communism--she describes how each of her grandmothers, and before themher great-grandfather, tried to navigate a dangerous line between conscience and compromise. <br>Ester and Ruzya is a spellbinding work of storytelling, filled with political intrigue and passionate emotion, acts of courage and acts of betrayal. At once an intimate family chronicle and a fascinating historical tale, it interweaves the stories of two women with a brilliant vision of Russian history. The result is a memoir that reads like a novel--and an extraordinary testament to the bonds of family and the power of hope, love, and endurance. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p><b>Masha Gessen&nbsp;</b>is a staff writer at <i>The New Yorker</i> and the author of several books, among them <i>The Future Is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia </i>and <i>The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin</i>.<i> </i>The recipient of numerous awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Carnegie Fellowship, Gessen teaches at Amherst College and lives in New York City.</p><h2>The Art of Social Media: Power Tips for Power Users</h2><p>By now it's clear that whether you're promoting a business, a product, or yourself, social media is near the top of what determines your success or failure.

All social-media platforms provide a &#x201c;profile&#x201d; page for you to explain who you are. This is for biographical information and images. An effective profile is vital because people use it to make a snap judgment about your account.</p><p>The goal of a profile is to convince people to pay attention to your social-media activities. Essentially, it is a r�sum� for the entire world to see and judge. This chapter explains how to optimize your profile to maximize its effectiveness.</p><p>1. Pick a Neutral Screen Name</p><p>Before we work on your profile, let&#x2019;s pick a good screen name. Today&#x2019;s clever name, such as @MartiniMom or @HatTrickHank, is tomorrow&#x2019;s regret, and you&#x2019;re not going to work for the same company forever, so @GuyMacEvangelist is risky too. Imagine it&#x2019;s two years from now and you&#x2019;re looking for a job. Now pick a name.</p><p>You probably already have a screen name, but the longer you use a lousy one, the harder it will be to change it later, and the more negative effects it will cause. Our recommendation is that you use a simple and logical screen name. In my case, that&#x2019;s &#x201c;Guy Kawasaki,&#x201d; not &#x201c;G. Kawasaki,&#x201d; &#x201c;GT Kawasaki,&#x201d; or &#x201c;G. T. Kawasaki.&#x201d; This is not the place for cleverness or complexity, so make it easy for people to find and remember you.</p><p>2. Optimize for Five Seconds</p><p>People do not <i>study</i> profiles. They spend a few seconds looking and make a snap decision. If this were online dating, think Tinder (swipe right for yes, swipe left for no) versus eHarmony (complete the Relationship Questionnaire).</p><p>Your profile should give the impression that you are likable, trustworthy, and competent. Platforms provide space for this information:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Avatar. This is a small circular or square picture of you or your logo.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&#x201c;Cover&#x201d; (Google+, Facebook, and LinkedIn) or &#x201c;header&#x201d; (Twitter). This picture is the largest graphic element in a profile and visually tells your story.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Biographical text. This is a summary of your education and work experience.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Links. This is a list of links to your blog, website, and other social-media accounts.<br><p>3. Focus Your Avatar on Your Face</p><p>A good avatar does two things. First, it validates who you are by providing a picture, so people can see which Guy Kawasaki you are. (God help us if there is more than one.) Second, it supports the narrative that you&#x2019;re likable, trustworthy, and competent.</p><p>Your face provides the most data about what kind of person you are. Thus your avatar shouldn&#x2019;t show your family, friends, dog, or car, because there isn&#x2019;t room. This also means you should not use a logo or graphic design unless the avatar is for an organization.</p><p>Here are three additional avatar tips:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Go asymmetrical. Symmetry makes a picture less interesting, so don&#x2019;t stick your face exactly in the middle. Divide a picture into thirds and place your eyes near one of the vertical lines.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Face the light. The source of light should come from in front of you. If the light comes from behind you, your face will probably be underexposed unless you force a fill flash on your camera or use a photo editor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Think big. When people scan posts and comments, they see your avatar at a postage-stamp size. When they click on it, however, they should see a big, crisp photo, so upload a picture that is at least 600 pixels wide.<br><p>4. Stick with One Picture</p><p>If companies used different logos in different places, mass confusion would reign. Your picture is your social-media logo, so use the same one everywhere. This will help people recognize you on social-media platforms and reduce questions about whether, for example, @GuyKawasaki on Twitter is +GuyKawasaki on Google+.</p><p>5. Craft a Mantra</p><p>Most platforms enable you to add a tagline to your profile. Make this a mantra&#x2014;two to four words that explain why you or your organization exists. For example, my mantra is &#x201c;I empower people.&#x201d; Here are four theoretical mantras for companies:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Nike: authentic athletic performance<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;FedEx: peace of mind<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Google: democratizing information<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Canva: democratizing design<br><p>Finally, for the sake of consistency, ensure that your tagline/mantra is the same on every service.</p><p>6. Tell Your Story</p><p>In addition to an avatar, platforms permit a second, larger photo, called a &#x201c;cover&#x201d; (Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn) or a &#x201c;header&#x201d; (Twitter). Its purpose is to tell a story and communicate information about what&#x2019;s important to you. This is where you can show a photo of your family, dog, car, product, or passion.</p><p>Platforms change the optimal dimensions of avatars and cover/header photos all the time, so we monitor what the platforms do and regularly update in a blog post called &#x201c;Quick Tips for Great Social Media Graphics.&#x201d; Refer back to it whenever you want to know what&#x2019;s optimal.</p><p>The cover is also a place where you can blow your social-media credibility by not changing the default design that platforms provide. If you don&#x2019;t add a custom photo, you are screaming that you are clueless about social media. (There&#x2019;s an entire chapter about cluelessness coming up.)</p><p>You can have more fun and display more creativity with your cover photo than with your avatar.

Coyne</b> is professor emeritus at the University of Chicago in the Department of Ecology and Evolution, where he specialized in evolutionary genetics. His <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, <i>Why Evolution Is True,</i> was one of <i>Newsweek</i>&#x2019;s &#x201c;50 Books for Our Times&#x201d; in 2010.<p></p><p>PREFACE</p><p>The Genesis of This Book</p><p>&#x2014;Neil deGrasse Tyson</p><p>In February 2013, I debated a young Lutheran theologian on a hot-button topic: &#x201c;Are science and religion compatible?&#x201d; The site was the historic Circular Congregational Church in Charleston, South Carolina, one of the oldest churches in the American South. After both of us gave our twenty-minute spiels (she argued &#x201c;yes,&#x201d; while I said &#x201c;no&#x201d;), we were asked to sum up our views in a single sentence. I can&#x2019;t remember my own pr�cis, but I clearly recall the theologian&#x2019;s words: &#x201c;We must always remember that faith is a gift.&#x201d;</p><p>This was one of those <i>l&#x2019;esprit d&#x2019;escalier,</i> or &#x201c;wit of the staircase,&#x201d; moments, when you come up with the perfect response&#x2014;but only well after the opportunity has passed. For shortly after the debate was over, I not only remembered that <i>Gift</i> is the German word for &#x201c;poison,&#x201d; but saw clearly that the theologian&#x2019;s parting words undercut her very thesis that science and religion are compatible. Whatever I actually said, what I <i>should</i> have said was this: &#x201c;Faith may be a gift in religion, but in science it&#x2019;s poison, for faith is no way to find truth.&#x201d;</p><p>This book gives me a chance to say that now. It is about the different ways that science and religion regard faith, ways that make them incompatible for discovering what&#x2019;s true about our universe. My thesis is that religion and science compete in many ways to describe reality&#x2014;they both make &#x201c;existence claims&#x201d; about what is real&#x2014;but use different tools to meet this goal. And I argue that the toolkit of science, based on reason and empirical study, is reliable, while that of religion&#x2014;including faith, dogma, and revelation&#x2014;is unreliable and leads to incorrect, untestable, or conflicting conclusions. Indeed, by relying on faith rather than evidence, religion renders itself <i>incapable</i> of finding truth.</p><p>I maintain, then&#x2014;and here I diverge from the many &#x201c;accommodationists&#x201d; who see religion and science, if not harmonious or complementary, at least as not in conflict&#x2014;that religion and science are engaged in a kind of war: a war for understanding, a war about whether we should have good reasons for what we accept as true.</p><p>Although this book deals with the conflict between religion and science, I see this as only one battle in a wider war&#x2014;a war between rationality and superstition. Religion is but a single brand of superstition (others include beliefs in astrology, paranormal phenomena, homeopathy, and spiritual healing), but it is the most widespread and harmful form of superstition. And science is but one form of rationality (philosophy and mathematics are others), but it is a highly developed form, and the only one capable of describing and understanding reality. All superstitions that <i>purport</i> to give truths are actually forms of pseudoscience, and all use similar tactics to immunize themselves against disproof. As we&#x2019;ll see, advocates of pseudosciences like homeopathy or ESP often support their beliefs using the same arguments employed by theologians to defend their faith.</p><p>While the science-versus-religion debate is one battle in the war between rationality and irrationality, I concentrate on it for several reasons. First, the controversy has become more widespread and visible, most likely because of a new element in the criticism of religion. The most novel aspect of &#x201c;New Atheism&#x201d;&#x2014;the form of disbelief that distinguishes the views of writers like Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins from the &#x201c;old&#x201d; atheism of people like Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertrand Russell&#x2014;is the observation that most religions are grounded in claims that can be regarded as <i>scientific. </i>That is,<i> </i>God, and the tenets of many religions, are <i>hypotheses</i> that can, at least in principle, be examined by science and reason. If religious claims can&#x2019;t be substantiated with reliable evidence, the argument goes, they should, like dubious scientific claims, be rejected until more data arrive. This argument is buttressed by new developments in science, in areas like cosmology, neurobiology, and evolutionary biology. Discoveries in those fields have undermined religious claims that phenomena like the origin of the universe and the existence of human morality and consciousness defy scientific explanation and are therefore evidence for God. Seeing their bailiwick shrinking, the faithful have become more insistent that religion is actually a way of understanding nature that complements science. But the most important reason to concentrate on religion rather than other forms of irrationality is not to document a historical conflict, but because, among all forms of superstition, religion has by far the most potential for public harm. Few are damaged by belief in astrology; but, as we&#x2019;ll see in the final chapter, many have been harmed by belief in a particular god or by the idea that faith is a virtue.</p><p>I have both a personal and a professional interest in this argument, for I&#x2019;ve spent my adult life teaching and studying evolutionary biology, the brand of science most vilified and rejected by religion. And a bit more biography is in order: I was raised as a secular Jew, an upbringing that, as most people know, is but a hairsbreadth from atheism. But my vague beliefs in a God were abandoned almost instantly when, at seventeen, I was listening to the Beatles&#x2019; <i>Sergeant Pepper</i> album and suddenly realized that there was simply no evidence for the religious claims I had been taught&#x2014;or for anybody else&#x2019;s, either. From the beginning, then, my unbelief rested on an absence of evidence for anything divine. Compared with that of many believers, my rejection of God was brief and painless. But after that I didn&#x2019;t think much about religion until I became a professional scientist.</p><p>There&#x2019;s no surer route to immersion in the conflict between science and religion than becoming an evolutionary biologist. Nearly half of Americans reject evolution completely, espousing a biblical literalism in which every living species, or at least our own, was suddenly created from nothing less than ten thousand years ago by a divine being. And most of the rest believe that God <i>guided</i> evolution one way or another&#x2014;a position that flatly rejects the naturalistic view accepted by evolutionary biologists: that evolution, like all phenomena in the universe, is a consequence of the laws of physics, without supernatural involvement. In fact, only about one in five Americans accepts evolution in the purely naturalistic way scientists see it.</p><p>When I taught my first course in evolution at the University of Maryland, I could hear the opposition directly, for in the plaza right below my classroom a preacher would often hold forth loudly about how evolution was a tool of Satan. And many of my own students, while dutifully learning about evolution, made it clear that they didn&#x2019;t believe a word of it. Curious about how such opposition could exist despite the copious evidence for evolution, I began reading about creationism. It was immediately evident that virtually all opposition to evolution comes from religion. In fact, among the dozens of prominent creationists I&#x2019;ve encountered, I&#x2019;ve known of only one&#x2014;the philosopher David Berlinski&#x2014;whose view isn&#x2019;t motivated by religion.</p><p>Finally, after twenty-five years of teaching, facing pushback all the way, I decided to address the problem of creationism in the only way I knew: by writing a popular book laying out the evidence for evolution. And there were mountains of evidence, drawn from the fossil record, embryology, molecular biology, the geography of plants and animals, the development and construction of animal bodies, and so on. Curiously, nobody had written such a book. Practical people, I figured&#x2014;or even skeptical ones&#x2014;would surely come around to accepting the scientific view of evolution once they&#x2019;d seen the evidence laid out in black and white.</p><p>I was wrong. Although my book, <i>Why Evolution Is True,</i> did well (even nosing briefly onto the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list), and although I received quite a few letters from religious readers telling me I&#x2019;d &#x201c;converted&#x201d; them to evolution, the proportion of creationists in America didn&#x2019;t budge: for thirty-two years it&#x2019;s hovered between 40 and 46 percent.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t take long to realize the futility of using evidence to sell evolution to Americans, for faith led them to discount and reject the facts right before their noses. In my earlier book I recounted the &#x201c;aha&#x201d; moment when I realized this. A group of businessmen in a ritzy suburb of Chicago, wanting to learn some science as a respite from shoptalk, invited me to talk to them about evolution at their weekly luncheon. I gave them a lavishly illustrated lecture about the evidence for evolution, complete with photos of transitional fossils, vestigial organs, and developmental anomalies like the vanishing leg buds of embryonic dolphins. They seemed to appreciate my efforts. But after the talk, one of the attendees approached me, shook my hand, and said, &#x201c;Dr. Coyne, I found your evidence for evolution very convincing&#x2014;but I still don&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201d;</p><p>I was flabbergasted. How could it be that someone found evidence convincing but <i>was still not convinced</i>? The answer, of course, was that his religion had immunized him against my evidence.</p><p>As a scientist brought up without much religious indoctrination, I couldn&#x2019;t understand how <i>anything</i> could blinker people against hard data and strong evidence. Why couldn&#x2019;t people be religious and still accept evolution? That question led me to the extensive literature on the relationship between science and religion, and the discovery that much of it is indeed what I call &#x201c;accommodationist&#x201d;: seeing the two areas as compatible, mutually supportive, or at least not in conflict. But as I dug deeper, and began to read theology as well, I realized that there were intractable incompatibilities between science and religion, ones glossed over or avoided in the accommodationist literature.</p><p>Further, I began to see that theology itself, or at least the truth claims religion makes about the universe, turns it into a kind of science, but a science using weak evidence to make strong statements about what is true. As a scientist, I saw deep parallels between theology&#x2019;s empirical and reason-based justifications for belief and the kind of tactics used by pseudoscientists to defend their turf. One of these is an a priori<i> </i>commitment to defend and justify one&#x2019;s preferred claims, something that stands in strong contrast to science&#x2019;s practice of constantly testing whether its claims might be wrong. Yet religious people were staking their very lives and futures on evidence that wouldn&#x2019;t come close to, say, the kind of data the U.S. government requires before approving a new drug for depression. In the end I saw that the claims for the compatibility of science and religion were weak, resting on assertions about the nature of religion that few believers really accept, and that religion could never be made compatible with science without diluting it so seriously that it was no longer religion but a humanist philosophy.</p><p>And so I learned what other opponents of creationism could have told me: that persuading Americans to accept the truth of evolution involved not just an education in facts, but a de-education in faith&#x2014;the form of belief that replaces the need for evidence with simple emotional commitment. I will try to convince you that religion, as practiced by most believers, is severely at odds with science, and that this conflict is damaging to science itself, to how the public conceives of science, and to what the public thinks science can and cannot not tell us. I&#x2019;ll also argue that the claim that religion and science are complementary &#x201c;ways of knowing&#x201d; gives unwarranted credibility to faith, a credibility that, at its extremes, is responsible for many human deaths and might ultimately contribute to the demise of our own species and much other life on Earth.</p><p>Science and religion, then, are competitors in the business of finding out what is true about our universe. In this goal religion has failed miserably, for its tools for discerning &#x201c;truth&#x201d; are useless. These areas are incompatible in precisely the same way, and in the same sense, that rationality is incompatible with irrationality.</p><p>Let me hasten, though, to add a few caveats.</p><p>First, some &#x201c;religions,&#x201d; like Jainism and the more meditation-oriented versions of Buddhism, make few or no claims about what exists in the universe. (I&#x2019;ll shortly give a definition of &#x201c;religion&#x201d; so that my thesis becomes clear.) Adherents to other faiths, like Quakers and Unitarian Universalists, are heterogeneous, with some &#x201c;believers&#x201d; being indistinguishable from agnostics or atheists who practice a nebulous but godless spirituality. As the beliefs of such people are often not <i>theistic</i> (that is, they don&#x2019;t involve a deity that interacts with the world), there is less chance that they will conflict with science. This book deals largely with theistic faiths. They&#x2019;re not the totality of religions, but they constitute by far the largest number of religions&#x2014;and believers&#x2014;on Earth.</p><p>For several reasons I concentrate on the Abrahamic faiths: Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Those are the religions I know most about, and, more important, are the ones&#x2014;particularly Christianity&#x2014;most concerned with reconciling their beliefs with science. While I discuss other faiths in passing, it is mostly the various brands of Christianity that occupy this book. Likewise, I will talk mostly about science and religion in the United States, for here is where their conflict is most visible. The problem is less pressing in Europe because the proportion of theists, particularly in northern Europe, is much lower than in America. In the Middle East, on the other hand, where Islam is truly and deeply in conflict with science, such discussions are often seen as heretical.</p><p>Finally, there are some versions of even the Abrahamic religions whose tenets are so vague that it&#x2019;s simply unclear whether they conflict with science. Apophatic, or &#x201c;negative,&#x201d; theology, for instance, is reluctant to make claims about the nature or even the existence of a god. Some liberal Christians speak of God as a &#x201c;ground of being&#x201d; rather than as an entity with humanlike feelings and properties that behaves in specified ways. While some theologians claim that these are the &#x201c;strongest&#x201d; notions of God, they have that status only because they make the fewest claims and are thus the least susceptible to refutation&#x2014;or even discussion. For anyone having the least familiarity with religion, it goes without saying that such watered-down versions of faith are not held by most people, who accept instead a personal god who intervenes in the world.</p><p>This brings us to the common claim that critics of religion accept a &#x201c;straw man&#x201d; fallacy, seeing all believers as fundamentalists or scriptural literalists, and that we neglect the &#x201c;strong and sophisticated&#x201d; versions of faith held by liberal theologians. A true discussion of faith/science compatibility, this argument runs, demands that we deal only with these sophisticated forms of belief. For if we construe &#x201c;religion&#x201d; as simply &#x201c;the beliefs of the average believer,&#x201d; then arguing that those beliefs are incompatible with scien...</p></p><h2>The Philosophy of Set Theory: An Historical Introduction to Cantor&#39;s Paradise (Dover Books on Mathematics);An;Dover Books on Mathematics</h2><p>This volume offers a guided tour of modern mathematics&#39; Garden of Eden, beginning with perspectives on the finite universe and classes and Aristotelian logic.

This last incident, with its rapid transit from life to death, hits Rabbit particularly hard: </p><blockquote> Imagine sitting there in your seat being lulled by the hum of the big Rolls-Royce engines and the stewardesses bring the clinking drinks caddy... and then with a roar and giant ripping noise and scattered screams this whole cozy world dropping away and nothing under you but black space and your chest squeezed by the terrible unbreathable cold, that cold you can scarcely believe is there but that you sometimes actually feel still packed into the suitcases, stored in the unpressurized hold, when you unpack your clothes, the dirty underwear and beach towels with the merciless chill of death from outer space still in them. </blockquote> Marching through the decades, John Updike's first three Rabbit novels--<i>Rabbit, Run</i> (1960), <i>Rabbit Redux</i> (1971), and <i>Rabbit Is Rich</i> (1981)--dissect middle-class America in all its dysfunctional glory. <i>Rabbit at Rest</i> (1990), the final installment and winner of the Pulitzer Prize, continues this brilliant dissection. Yet it also develops Rabbit's character more fully as he grapples with an uncertain future and the consequences of his past. At one point, for example, he's taken his granddaughter Judy for a sailing expedition when his first heart attack strikes. Rabbit gamely navigates the tiny craft to shore--and then, lying on the beach, feels a paradoxical relief at having both saved his beloved Judy and meeting his own death. (He doesn't, not yet.) Meanwhile, this all-American dad feels responsible for his son's full-blown drug addiction but incapable of helping him. (Ironically, it's Rabbit's wife Janice, the "poor dumb mutt," who marches Nelson into rehab.)<p> His misplaced sense of responsibility--plus his crude sexual urges and racial slurs--can make Rabbit seems less than lovable. Still, there's something utterly heroic about his character. When the end comes, after all, it's the Angstrom family that refuses to accept the reality of Rabbit's mortality. Only Updike's irreplaceable mouthpiece rises to the occasion, delivering a stoical, one-word valediction: "Enough." <i>--Rob McDonald</i></p>13 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Age of Empyre (Legends of the First Empire, 6)</h2><p><strong>The epic battle between humankind and their godlike rulers concludes in the masterful ending to <em>Age of Myth</em>, <em>Age of Swords</em>, <em>Age of War</em>, <em>Age of Legend</em>, and <em>Age of Death</em>.</strong></p><p><strong>Michael J.

"I'm white--is race really something I need to talk about? I'm worried I'll be called a racist!" "What does race have to do with faith, anyway?" "Why do we have to keep talking about this?"<br>If talking about racism makes you anxious, afraid, or even angry, you're not alone. In <i>Anxious to Talk about It,</i> pastor and professor Carolyn B. Helsel draws on her success with white congregations to offer insight and tools to embrace, explore and work through the anxious feelings that often arise in these hard conversations. Through powerful personal stories, new observations on racial identity development, and spiritual practices to help engage issues of racial justice prayerfully, you'll gain a deeper understanding of race in America and your place in it. You will learn how to join conversations with courage, compassion, and knowledge of self, others, and the important issues at stake. Helsel's guidance will inspire you to receive the gifts that come through these difficult race conversations and point to how you can get further involved in the important social justice work around race relations. Each chapter ends with questions for reflection and discussion to further help you get the conversations started.<br><br>While <i>Anxious to Talk about It </i>can be read alone, reading with a group will deepen the discussion, integrate the material, and provide opportunities to practice. A free Study Guide and other group resources are available at www.chalicepress.com.</p><p>Carolyn B. Helsel teaches preaching at Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary and is a minister in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). She holds a PhD from Emory University and MDiv and ThM degrees from Princeton Seminary. Native to Texas, she is currently studying the experience of Texan identity and how that relates to race. Helsel has been featured on Austin's NPR radio station and in <i>The Presbyterian Outlook</i>, and has led workshops for the White Privilege Conference and Festival of Homiletics. She is a sought-after speaker and preacher at churches around the country.This book is spot-on for the kinds of conversations we need to be having. Carolyn Helsel offers ready access to approach the hard issues of race without being adversarial. Her writing is deeply personal, reflecting her own path of growth. At the same time it is acutely informed by developmental theory and is pervaded by a generous pastoral sensibility. --Walter Brueggemann, Columbia Theological Seminary, author of <i>Sabbath As Resistance, The Prophetic Imagination</i>, and other books.<br><br>We white Christians engage in conversation about a number of important issues. But there is one conversation we are loathe to have: talk about race. We get edgy and nervous when talk turns to America s original sin. Carolyn Helsel gives us the background, the context, and the history we need in order to engage in this painful but so very important conversation. Helsel also gives us specific, practical guidance in how to instigate conversations about race in our churches. Thanks to God for this useful, important book! --Will Willimon, Duke Divinity School, United Methodist Bishop (retired), and author of <i>Who Lynched Willie Earle? Preaching to Confront Racism </i><br><br>In this useful book, Helsel, a Presbyterian pastor and professor of preaching at Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary, lends her perspective as an academic, a member of the clergy, and a white woman to the conversation about race in contemporary America. Helsel divulges personal stories as well as stories taken from the lives of people she has met while preaching and during her time working with the Oral History Project.... In Helsel s thesis, public, communal healing must begin with spiritual inner peace and a love of brotherhood found through Christ. This slim but powerful book will be of most use to white readers looking for a way to have honest conversations about race. --<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, 02/11/18</p><h2>Speaking Christian: Why Christian Words Have Lost Their Meaning and Power&#x2015;And How They Can Be Restored</h2><p><p>In <em>Speaking Christian</em>, acclaimed Bible scholar Marcus Borg, author of <em>Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time</em>, argues that the very language Christians use has become dangerously distilled, distorted, and disconnected from the beliefs which once underpinned it.</p><p>Stating a case that will resonate with readers of N. T. Wright&#x2019;s <em>Simply Christian</em>, Borg calls for a radical change to the language we use to invoke our beliefs&#x2014;the only remedy that will allow the Church's words to once again ring with truth, power, and hope.</p></p><p><p>Modern Christians are steeped in a language so distorted that it has become a stumbling block to the religion, says internationally renowned Bible scholar Marcus J. Borg. Borg argues that Christianity&#x2019;s important words, and the sacred texts and stories in which those words are embedded, have been narrowed by a modern framework for the faith that emphasizes sin, forgiveness, Jesus dying for our sins, and the afterlife. Here, Borg employs the &#x201c;historical-metaphorical&#x201d; method for understanding Christian language that can restore for us these words of power and transformation. For example,</p><ul> <li><em>Redemption</em>: now narrowly understood as Jesus saving us from sins so we can go to heaven, but in the Bible it refers to being set free from slavery.</li> <li><em>Savior</em>: now refers to Jesus as the one who saves us from our sins, but in the Bible it has a rich and wonderful variety of meanings having nothing to do with the afterlife.</li> <li><em>Sacrifice</em>: now refers to Jesus&#x2019;s death on the cross as payment for our sins, but in the Bible it is never about substitutionary payment for sin.</li></ul><p>In <em>Speaking Christian</em>, Borg delivers a language for twenty-first-century Christians that grounds the faith in its deep and rich original roots and allows it once again to transform our lives.</p><p>Marcus J. Borg (1942&#x2013;2015) was a pioneering author and teacher whom the <em>New York Times</em> described as "a leading figure in his generation of Jesus scholars." He was the Hundere Distinguished Professor of Religion and Culture at Oregon State University and canon theologian at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Portland, and he appeared on NBC's <em>The Today Show</em> and <em>Dateline</em>, ABC's <em>World News</em>, and NPR's <em>Fresh Air</em>. His books have sold over a million copies, including the bestselling <em>Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time</em>, <em>Reading the Bible Again for the First Time</em>, <em>Jesus</em>, <em>The Heart of Christianity</em>, <em>Evolution of the Word</em>, <em>Speaking Christian</em>, and <em>Convictions</em>.</p></p><h2>On Being Different: What It Means to Be a Homosexual (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>The groundbreaking work on being homosexual in America&#x2014;available again only from Penguin Classics and with a new foreword by Dan Savage</b><br><br>Originally published in 1971, Merle Miller&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>On Being Different</i>&nbsp;is a pioneering and thought-provoking book about being homosexual in the United States.

But her spirit lives today.</b><p>Jezebel was the most wicked woman in the Bible, a powerful seductress who killed the prophets, led Israel into idolatry and immorality, and emasculated men. She was seductive and determined to snuff out the voices coming against her, because these voices were calling out for repentance.</p><p>In twenty-first-century America, Jezebel is not a person. But it&#x2019;s as if the spirit of Jezebel is alive again today. The influence of the same demonic force is being felt in the massive increase of pornography and sexual temptation, the militant spirit of abortion, the rise of radical feminism, and most importantly, in the attempt to silence prophetic voices. Just as Jezebel clashed with strong men almost three thousand years ago, the demonic spirit of Jezebel is powerful in America, and it is going after the church.</p><p>This eye-opening book not only unveils the satanic plot to destroy America, beginning with an all-out assault on the church, but it will equip every believer with tools to defeat the enemy in their own personal lives as well as in the nation.<br><br> This book will show you how the spirit of Jezebel is active in America today and teach you how to protect the church.<br><br><b>OTHER BOOKS BY MICHAEL L.

This is a heavy subject. It is a dangerous subject. It evokes a demonic response. It is one of hell&#x2019;s heroes. As I read the manuscript of this book after being invited to write an endorsement, I was moved for days. I took an inventory of my own heart. The spirit of Jezebel is active in the earth today. It comes to intimidate, control, and threaten. A study by George Barna reveals that 92 percent of pastors in America, when surveyed, stated that they say nothing in sermons about our greatest national issues. That sounds like the results of the intimidation of Jezebel. Since you have decided to read this book, get ready to be stirred. The spirit of Jezebel is back&#x2014;and intends to shut up your voice of life, of freedom, of truth. The answer to overcoming this treacherous spirit is found in this book. It is timely, important, and anointed."<br><b>&#x2014;Pastor Mike Hayes,&nbsp;</b>Founding Pastor, Covenant Church<br><br>"American culture continues to change at rapid speed, with waves of social chaos and consternation forcing many Christians to wonder how we ended up in such a dire predicament.

Dolly Merishaw is a midwife and an abortionist in Victorian Toronto, but although she keeps quiet about her clients' condition, her contempt and greed leaves them resentful and angry. So it comes as no surprise when this malicious woman is murdered. What is a shock, though, is that a week later a young boy is found dead in Dolly's squalid kitchen. Now, Detective Murdoch isn't sure if he's hunting one murderer - or two.</p></p><p>Maureen Jennings sets up this 19th-century tale of blackmail and murder rather like a jigsaw puzzle: each chapter introduces new clues, new characters, and new points of view until the complete picture is revealed. As we discover who might have suffocated Dolly Shaw, a capricious, demanding drunkard, Jennings explores the permutations and stratifications of society in Toronto at the close of the century. Although the victim is a violent, scheming wretch of humble dwelling and few connections, her death draws in the range of men and women who employed her services in her profession as a midwife: the wife of a prominent judge who seems to care for little except fashionable clothes and her young ward; a theatrical performer who sells her various talents both before and behind the stage; and the detective, William Murdoch, who tries to solve the mystery and appease his own loneliness after the death of his fianc�e. <p> Jennings has a subtle touch. She not only explores Canadian society caught between the stiffer British and the more freewheeling Americans but also considers the period's reliance on patent medicines for everything from inducing miscarriages to promoting virility; examines the shifting athletic interests after the introduction of the bicycle; and evokes the stink of stale beer sold cheaply to the city's poor. Her ear for 19th-century language is more true and her evil deeds are less foul than those of Anne Perry. And while she lacks the rollicking good humor of Elizabeth Peters (although there are a few light moments), she is much more accessible than the sometimes impermeable Peter Ackroyd. <i>Under the Dragon's Tail</i> is a worthwhile book and a solid follow-up to Jennings's first, <i>Except the Dying</i>. <i>--K.A. Crouch</i></p>MAUREEN JENNINGS's first novel in the Detective Murdoch series, <i>Except the Dying</i>, was published to rave reviews and shortlisted for both the Arthur Ellis and the Anthony first novel awards.

While most children's books in the 18th century contained lessons and rules, John Newbery imagined them overflowing with entertaining stories, science, and games. He believed that every book should be made for the reader's enjoyment. Newbery&#x2014;for whom the prestigious Newbery Medal is named&#x2014;became a celebrated author and publisher, changing the world of children's books forever. This book about his life and legacy is as full of energy and delight as any young reader could wish.</p><p>Michelle Markel writes informative, enjoyable children's books at her home in Los Angeles.<br><br>Nancy Carpenter has illustrated over 30 books for children. She lives in Brooklyn, New York, with her family.K-Gr 2&#x2014;This winning picture book takes on a subject that one wouldn't think, at first glance, would be of interest to modern-day audiences&#x2014;a look at the life of an 18th-century publisher and shopkeeper. But said publisher is none other than John Newbery, who embraced the teachings of John Locke and is credited with introducing the notion that children's books should be engaging and entertaining instead of strictly instructional and religious. We are all greatly in his debt. Markel's delightfully exuberant treatment follows Newbery's lead and presents the facts of his life in a wholly original and absorbing way, mixing evocative and richly detailed cartoon artwork, a playful use of typography, and visual and textual homages to his books and legacy. Carpenter relies on sepia ink, and the pages are digitally made to look old and weathered. Readers learn that Newbery was a savvy businessman, selling patented medicine, magazines, and toys in addition to his carefully selected books and was not at all assured that his ventures would succeed. "Will the parents buy them? Are they too...cheerful? The children gobbled them up like plum cakes." The back matter is fully sourced and extensive and includes biographical detail as well as descriptions of the books mentioned. VERDICT This title is a fun read-aloud with multiple curricular connections. A stellar introduction to "the father of children's literature," and a glorious example of dynamic bookmaking.

This collection of his work makes the reasons for his survival self-evident. In prose of bleak but piercing clarity, Camus cuts to the heart of each story he tells. After The Outsider (also published in Everyman) The Plague is his most powerful novel, at once an account of heroic attempts to contain an epidemic in Algeria and a parable of the human condition. In The Fall a once-successful Parisian lawyer tells his own tale of decline and self-discovery, Exile and the Kingdom collect together a number of short stories which explore the existentialist predicament from various viewpoints. This volume also contains two important essays - The Myth of Sisyphus and Reflections on the Guillotine - which reflect on the themes developed in the fiction.</p><p>A haunting tale of human resilience in the face of unrelieved horror, Camus' novel about a bubonic plague ravaging the people of a North African coastal town is a classic of twentieth-century literature. <p>"From the Trade Paperback edition.</p>Born in Algeria in 1913, Albert Camus published The Stranger-- now one of the most widely read novels of this century-- in 1942.

Kemp lives and works in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, with his wife, twin sons, and a couple of cats.THE PRESENT<br> &nbsp;<br> JADEN FOUND HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES, THE ROOM SPINNING. Blood leaked from his right temple, spattered the floor in little crimson circles. More blood oozed from the stumps of his fingers. Pain blurred his vision, clouded his thinking. The short, rapid shrieks of an alarm blared in his ears, rising and falling in time with the dim flashes of overhead backup lights. Strange lights. Like little starbursts buried deep in the green resin of the ceiling. A haze of black smoke congealed near the ceiling and darkened air that stank of melted plastoid, rubber, and ozone. He thought he caught the faint stink of decaying flesh but could not be sure.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gingerly he placed his unwounded hand to his right temple, felt the warm, sticky blood, the small hole there. The blood was fresh; the wound recent.<br> &nbsp;<br> The rapid flashes of the lights made his movements seem herky-jerky, not his own, the stop-starts of a marionette in unpracticed hands. His body ached. He felt as if he&#x2019;d been beaten. The stumps of the fingers he&#x2019;d lost on the frozen moon throbbed, the wounds somehow reopened and seeping pus. His skull felt as if someone had driven a nail through it.<br> &nbsp;<br> And he had no idea where he was.<br> &nbsp;<br> He thought he felt eyes on him. He looked around the dark corridor, his eyes unable to focus. He saw no one. The floor vibrated under him, as if coursing with power, the rale of enormous lungs. He found the feeling disquieting. Filaments dangled like entrails from irregular gashes torn in the walls. Black scorch marks bordered the gashes. A control panel, a dark rectangle, hung loose from an aperture in the wall, as if blown out by a power surge.<br> &nbsp;<br> He found it difficult to focus for long on anything before his field of vision started to spin. His bleary eyes watered from the smoke. The flashing lights and the wail of the siren disoriented him, would not let him gather his thoughts.<br> &nbsp;<br> The pain in his head simply would not relent. He wanted to scream, to dig his fingers into his brain and root out the agony. He&#x2019;d never felt anything like it.<br> &nbsp;<br> What had happened to him?<br> &nbsp;<br> He could not remember. Worse, he could not think clearly.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then he felt it: the faint tang of dark-side energy. Its taint suffused the air, greasy on his skin, angry, evil. He swallowed down a dry throat.<br> &nbsp;<br> Had he been attacked by a Sith?<br> &nbsp;<br> With an effort of will, he pushed the touch of the dark side away from his core, held it at arm&#x2019;s length. Having an enemy gave him focus. He steeled himself against the pain in his head and stood on weak legs. Each beat of his heart felt like a hammer blow to his skull. Pound. Pound.<br> &nbsp;<br> He tried to hold his ground but the room began to spin more rapidly, the alarm loud in his ears, the floor growling under him, the ringing, spinning, whirling. He wobbled, swayed. Nausea pushed bile into the back of his throat.<br> &nbsp;<br> Without warning, the pain in his temple spiked, a white-hot flash of agony that summoned a prolonged scream. His wail rebounded off the walls, carried off into the darkness, and with the scream as a sound track, a flood of memories and images streamed across his consciousness, rapid flashes of colors, faces, a series of half-remembered or half-imagined things. He was unable to focus for long on any of the images, unable to slow them down; they blazed in and out of his awareness like sparks, flashing for a moment, then gone, leaving only a shadowy afterimage.<br> &nbsp;<br> He squeezed his eyes shut and clamped his mouth closed to cut off the scream. The pain would not stop. His head was going to explode, surely it was going to burst.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was teetering, his head pounding, his stomach in his throat, his eyes watering.<br> &nbsp;<br> Unable to keep his feet, he sagged back to the floor. The spinning began to subside. The pain, too, began to fade. He sagged with relief. He would not have been able to bear much more.<br> &nbsp;<br> Clarity replaced pain, and as his head cleared, images and events refitted themselves into the jigsaw puzzle of his memory, reconstituted him from their fragments. He sank into the Force, found comfort there. He closed his eyes for a time and when he opened them, he looked about with what felt like new eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> He sat in the middle of a wide corridor. The dim, intermittent flashes of the strange overhead lights showed little detail. The walls, ceilings, and floors were composed of a substance he&#x2019;d never seen before, light green, semitranslucent. At first he thought it was some form of plastoid, or hued transparisteel, but no, it was a resin of some kind. For the first time, he realized that the floor was not merely vibrating under him, it was warm, like flesh. Faint lines of light glowed deep within it, barely visible, capillaries of luminescence. The arrangement looked ordered, a matrix of some kind, and the pattern of their flashes was not random, though he could not look at it long without its flashes disorienting him.<br> &nbsp;<br> He tried to make sense of what he was seeing. The architecture, the technology it implied&nbsp;...<br> &nbsp;<br> Where was he?<br> &nbsp;<br> A word leapt to the forefront of his mind, a flash that came and went without explanation.<br> Rakatan.<br> &nbsp;<br> He leaned forward, trying to remember, feeling as if he were on the verge of some revelation. He tried to pull the word back, to force it to take on meaning and make sense, but it eluded him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rakatan,&#x201d; he said, and the word sounded strange on his lips. Saying it aloud triggered no more memories.<br> &nbsp;<br> But more and more memories were clicking into place, connecting names, events, and faces, the backstory of his life being told just below the level of his consciousness. He must have been hit on the head, hit hard. Understanding would come eventually, or so he hoped.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet he knew he could not sit still and wait for it. The dark side was all around him. Palpable anger polluted the air, pressed against him. Alarms were wailing. The vibrations in the floor rose and fell like lungs, lurching, not so much like ordinary breathing as a death rale. He had to get away from wherever he was.<br> &nbsp;<br> An explosion rumbled somewhere in the distance and everything shook.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was in a ship then, or a station of some kind. He looked for a viewport but saw none.<br> &nbsp;<br> He crawled over to the wall and used it to help himself stand. The pain in the stumps of his fingers caused him to wince. The smooth surface of the wall pulsed faintly under his touch and he had the sudden, uncomfortable fear that he had awakened in the belly of some nameless pseudomechanical beast, that he&#x2019;d been swallowed and was now being slowly digested.<br> &nbsp;<br> Licking his lips, he stood away from the wall. His wounded fingers had left bloody smears on the smooth green surface.<br> &nbsp;<br> The comforting weight of his lightsaber hung from his belt and he put his hand on its cool hilt. He had made it....<br> &nbsp;<br> Where had he made it?<br> &nbsp;<br> On a ship. On Junker. He&#x2019;d made it on Junker.<br> &nbsp;<br> He remembered giving his other blade, the one he&#x2019;d made as a boy on Coruscant, to Marr.<br> To Marr.<br> &nbsp;<br> A face flashed in his memory: tan, weathered, a ruff of hair haloing a towering forehead. The face of a Cerean. Marr.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Marr?&#x201d; he called over the sirens, his raw voice bouncing down the corridor. In his mind&#x2019;s eye he saw a lazy eye, a malformed asymmetrical face, and a ready smile, and a name accompanied the image. &#x201c;Khedryn?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> No response.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> He took a moment to evaluate his physical condition, examining his limbs, chest, abdomen. Other than the reopened wounds on his hand and the small hole in his head, he&#x2019;d suffered no serious visible harm. He had been in a fight, though. His cheek felt sore to the touch; his ribs and his arms had several bruises, as if from blocking blows.<br> &nbsp;<br> He took inventory of his gear, sifting through pockets, the cases on his belt&#x2014;nutrition bars, extra power packs for his blaster, liquid rope, a glow lamp. No medpack, though.<br> &nbsp;<br> He took the glow lamp in his wounded hand and activated it. Its beam put a path of luminescence on the semitranslucent floor, down the corridor. The hair-thin filaments in the floor seemed to glow in response, the photons communicating in a tongue he could not comprehend. He fell in behind the beam of his glow lamp and tried to find a way out.<br> &nbsp;<br> He felt more himself as he moved. The corridor split repeatedly. Vertical seams in the walls opened wetly at his approach to reveal corridors and rooms beyond. Once more, he marveled at the technology.<br> &nbsp;<br> The smoke made his eyes leak, turned his throat raw. The blinking patterns of light in the walls and floor drew him on, will-o&#x2019;-the-wisps tempting him to some fate he did not understand. Distant explosions continued to rock the vessel and he staggered under their onslaught, his legs still weak.<br> &nbsp;<br> The energy of the dark side thickened. He was closing on its source. Its power alarmed him. He leaned into it, against it, as he might against a rainstorm. He flashed on a memory of Force lightning crackling out of his fingers, energy born of fear or anger. He studied his hands, the one unwounded, the other missing three fingers, and knew that fear and anger no longer held any power over him. Force lightning was not a weapon he would use again.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Getting Things Done Workbook: 10 Moves to Stress-Free Productivity</h2><p><p><b>An accessible, practical, step-by-step guide that supplements <i>Getting Things Done</i> by providing the details, the how-to's and the practices to apply GTD more fully and easily in daily life</b></p><p>The incredible popularity of <i>Getting Things Done</i> revealed people's need to take control of their own productivity with a system that reduces the stress of staying on top of it all.

It is symbolized in the temple ruins, and before it the temple itself, and before that the ark of the covenant and the tabernacle that housed it, and before that the Garden of Eden. In response to this longing, God shares his ultimate mission, in which his people play a part: the expansion of Eden, the temple of God's presence, to all peoples throughout the earth. The temple has always been a source of rich scholarship and theological reflection, but what does it mean for the church's ongoing mission in the world? G. K. Beale and Mitchell Kim take temple theology off the bookshelf and bring it to our modern-day life, where the church is instructed and exhorted in its purpose. From Eden to the new Jerusalem, we are God's temple on the earth in our day, the firstfruits of the new creation. God has always desired to dwell among us; now the church must follow its missional call to extend the borders of God's kingdom and take his presence to the ends of the earth.</p><p>G. K. Beale (PhD, University of Cambridge) holds the J. Gresham Machen Chair of New Testament and is professor of New Testament and biblical theology at Westminster Theological Seminary. His books include <em>The Book of Revelation</em> (New International Greek Testament Commentary), <em>1-2 Thessalonians</em> (The IVP New Testament Commentary Series), <em>The Right Doctrine from the Wrong Texts? Essays on the Use of the Old Testament in the New, John's Use of the Old Testament in Revelation, The Temple and the Church's Mission</em> and <em>We Become What We Worship.</em><br><br>Mitchell Kim (PhD, Wheaton College) is lead pastor of Living Water Alliance Church in the Chicago suburbs. Building on extensive experience in the immigrant church, he has helped found and guide Joshua Generation to equip youth workers to reach their generation for Christ. He also teaches Bible in the graduate school at Wheaton College and participated in the Lausanne Congress for World Evangelization in Cape Town, South Africa in 2010. Of Korean descent, he was born in southern California, raised in Tokyo and lives in Naperville, IL with his wife Eunsil and their three children."This approach to biblical theology, soundly exegetical and powerfully persuasive, not only will help the pastor place every text of Scripture within the context of the entire canon, but also understand every text of Scripture in terms of the everlasting purposes of God." (R. Albert Mohler Jr., Preaching, "The Year's Best Books for Preachers," March/April 2015)<br><br>"This is biblical theology at its best: rich, allusive, big-picture building, and applicatory. Beale and Kim will help you see how the entire Bible centers on the theme of God's presence with his people&#x2015;and what that means for daily life." (Caleb Nelson, World Magazine, December 20, 2014)<br><br>"Beale and Kim carefully emphasize the practical impacts of the 'temple' in the church, making this book especially useful for pastors and teachers. This theme can shape how we see God's mission, our churches, and ourselves." (Elliot Ritzema, Bible Study Magazine, March/April 2015)<br><br>"God dwelling in the midst of his people: this staggering vision is the heart of God's covenantal purposes from Genesis to Revelation. <em>God Dwells Among Us</em> brings decades of scholarship on this topic to a wider audience. More than that, it shows how this major biblical theme is the engine of mission in the world today. This clear and compelling study is a real feast." (Michael Horton, J. Gresham Machen Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics, Westminster Seminary California)<br><br>"In Scripture, God dwells not only up above the world but also among us, with us and within us. Our hearts long to hear more of God s presence, his promise to be with us. One important way for us to understand God s presence in Scripture is through its teaching about the temple and of Jesus as the true temple. Greg Beale has developed this theme cogently in scholarly writings. In <em>God Dwells Among Us</em> he and Mitchell Kim have made these ideas accessible to working pastors. It is a valuable aid to preaching and an excellent antidote to the feeling of loneliness that afflicts many today. I recommend it highly." (John Frame, professor of systematic theology and philosophy, Reformed Theological Seminary)<br><br>"This comprehensive biblical study uses Eden, the tabernacle, and the temple as parallels to portray God's work with his people. . . . Each chapter has a helpful summary and extensive footnotes. The concluding practical reflections provide useful motivation for readers to live the mission of the church."

For Connor, who is taken aboard a pirate ship, there&#39;s the chance to learn to swordfight, but for Grace, aboard a mysterious ship of vampire pirates, the danger is great. What will it take for them to find each other?</p><p>Justin Somper is a bestselling author in the UK. His <i>Vampirates </i>books have received international acclaim and have been published in over 20 languages. He lives in London.Grade 6-9&#x2013;Connor and Grace Tempest have grown up listening to their father's sea shanty about the Vampirates and their ancient ship...that haunts the oceans blue, a song that predates the changes that left their future world largely flooded. After his death leaves them orphaned and penniless, the 14-year-old twins run away to sea and are separated by a storm. Connor is rescued by a pirate ship, where he soon finds a place among its crewmates. Grace, on the other hand, has been rescued by a mysterious ship, which readers won't be surprised to find is the home of the Vampirates. The siblings become involved with the internal politics of each vessel, meeting new friends&#x2013;and new enemies, like the vampire Sidorio. Grace's sense of horror and wonder at the Vampirate lifestyle is clearly drawn, and her protector, Lorcan, and the living figurehead, Miss Flotsam, offer sympathy and clues to the ship's many mysteries. Swashbuckling Captain Wrathe and his crew feature a few stereotypes, but their adventure-filled lifestyle has a clear appeal to Connor and readers. This book is a good choice for reluctant readers, who will be drawn into the turns and twists of the twins' story, and the dramatic cover art will help catch their attention. This fantastic tale will find many fans, who will be left looking for answers to mysteries only begun to be answered here.<i>&#x2013;Beth L.

Nor did heknow who operated the estancia&#x2019;s eight slaughterhouses, of which Frigor�ficoMor�n had been one of the smallest, until recently, when Frigor�fico Mor�n hadbeen shut down to make room for the runways and hangars of South AmericanAirways.</p><p>The car and the truck slowed and turned off the macadam road onto a narrowerroad of crushed stone, then stopped when they came to a sturdy closedgate, above which a sign read Casa Chica.</p><p>A sturdy man in his fifties with a full, immaculately trimmed cavalryman&#x2019;smustache got out of the car and walked toward the gate, holding in his hand akey to the massive padlock that secured the chains in the gate.</p><p>He had just twisted the key in the lock when a man on horseback trottedup, holding a rifle vertically, its butt resting on the saddle. Without speakingto him&#x2014;which the man on horseback correctly interpreted to be a signal ofdisapproval; he knew he should have been at the gate before the man with themustache reached it&#x2014;the man returned to the Ford. He got in and waitedfor the peon to get off the horse and finish dealing with the chain and swingopen the gate.</p><p>When the car and truck had passed through the gate, the peon went to theright post of the gate, pulled a piece of canvas aside, and then knelt beside anArgentine copy of the U.S. Army&#x2019;s EE-8 field telephone. He gave its crank severalhard turns, then stood up, holding the headset to his ear as he looked upthe steep hill to Casa Chica.</p><p>An identical field telephone rang in the comfortable living room of CasaChica, a bungalow sitting near the crest of the hill.</p><p>There were five people in the room. A middle-aged balding man wearing asweater over his shirt sat across a desk from a younger man wearing a looselyknit white turtleneck sweater. A Thompson submachine gun hung from theback of the younger man&#x2019;s chair.</p><p>Another rifle-armed peon&#x2014;this one leaning back in a chair that restedagainst a wall&#x2014;had been on the edge of dozing off when the telephone rang. Alarge, even massive, dark-skinned woman in her thirties sat on a couch acrossfrom a middle-aged woman in an armchair, who was looking bitterly at themiddle-aged balding man at the desk. When the telephone rang, the largewoman rose with surprising agility from the couch and went to it.</p><p>The balding man stopped what he was doing, which was working on an organizationalchart, and looked at the massive woman.</p><p>&#x201c;You just keep on working, Herr Frogger,&#x201d; the young man said not verypleasantly in German.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have all these details in my memory, Major,&#x201d; Frogger said.</p><p>&#x201c;Try harder,&#x201d; the young man said coldly.</p><p>He was Sergeant Sigfried Stein, U.S. Army, although Herr Wilhelm Froggerand his wife, Else, had been told&#x2014;and believed&#x2014;that he was a major.</p><p>Until weeks before, Wilhelm Frogger had been the commercial attach� ofthe German Embassy in Buenos Aires. On the fourth of July, he had then appearedat the apartment of Milton Leibermann, a &#x201c;legal attach�&#x201d; of the U.S.Embassy, and offered to exchange his knowledge of German Embassy secretsfor sanctuary in Brazil.</p><p>Leibermann was <i>de facto</i> the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x2019;s man in Argentina.He had no place to hide the German defectors from either the Germansor the Argentine authorities&#x2014;who, he knew, would be told the Froggershad been kidnapped&#x2014;nor any means to get the defectors out of Argentina. Sohe had turned them over to someone he thought could do both.</p><p>He knew that Don Cletus Frade, patr�n of Estancia San Pedro y SanPablo, was in fact a U.S. Marine Corps major and the <i>de facto</i> head of theU.S. Office of Strategic Services in Argentina. He also knew that having anydealings at all with anyone connected with the spies of the OSS had been absolutelyforbidden by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and for that reasonLeibermann had not reported to the FBI that the Froggers had come to him,or what he had done with them.</p><p>Frade was interested in the Froggers because he knew more of the secretactivities of the German Embassy than Frogger thought he could possiblyknow, most importantly about something the Germans called &#x201c;OperationPhoenix.&#x201d;</p><p>Frogger steadfastly denied any knowledge of Operation Phoenix, whichconvinced Frade he was a liar. It had also become almost immediately apparentthat Frau Else Frogger was an unrepentant National Socialist who not onlyhad decided that defecting had been a mistake but that if they could only getaway from Frade and his <i>gottverdammt Jude</i>&#x2014;&#x201c;Major&#x201d; Stein&#x2014;all would be forgiven at the German Embassy.</p><p>Frade, however, knew enough about the SS officers in the German Embassyto know that before or after the Froggers were returned to Germany to enter aconcentration camp they would be thoroughly interrogated about Leibermannand about Frade&#x2019;s operation. And the Froggers had seen too much to let thathappen.</p><p>Letting them go was not an option.</p><p>Frade had no immediate means of getting them even to Brazil without takingunjustifiable risks. So while they were, so to speak, in limbo, he was hidingthem on a small farm that his father had used for romantic interludes in thecountry.</p><p>There was a chance that Siggie Stein could break down one of them&#x2014;orboth&#x2014;and get them to reveal what they knew about Operation Phoenix. Notmuch of a chance, though, for Stein was a demolitions man turned communications/cryptography expert, not a trained interrogator. Still, on the otherhand, he was a refugee from Nazi Germany, and had some relatives who&#x2019;d notbeen able to escape and had perished in concentration camps.</p><p>The massive Argentine woman, who was known as &#x201c;The Other Dorotea&#x201d;&#x2014;Don Cletus Frade&#x2019;s Anglo-Argentine wife was Do�a Dorotea Mall�n de Frade&#x2014;listened to the telephone and then reported, &#x201c;It is Suboficial Mayor Rodr�guez.&#x201d;Stein rose from his chair, picking up the Thompson.</p><p>&#x201c;Watch them,&#x201d; he said to the peon with the rifle, then turned to HerrFrogger and said, &#x201c;Keep at it,&#x201d; and then walked out of the room and onto theverandah to wait for Rodr�guez.</p><p>The incline in front of Casa Chica was very steep, and between the houseand the road and gate, but not visible from either, a landing strip had beencarved out of the hillside. Frade had told Stein his father had used it to flyhis lady love into the house in one of Estancia San Pedro y San Pablo&#x2019;s fleet ofPiper Cubs.</p><p>The car and the truck appeared a moment later, moving slowly in low gear,and turned onto the landing strip. When they stopped, Suboficial Mayor EnricoRodr�guez&#x2014;who had been Cavalry, Ej�rcito Argentino, and had retiredwith the late Coronel Jorge Frade from the H�sares de Pueyrred�n, Argentina&#x2019;smost prestigious cavalry regiment&#x2014;got out of the car and started toward thehouse, going up the stairs carved into the hillside. He carried a RemingtonModel 11 self-loading twelve-gauge riot shotgun in his hand.</p><p>The driver of the refrigerator truck got out from behind the wheel, went tothe rear doors, and pulled them open. A dozen peones, all armed with Mauserrifles, began to pile out of the truck and then to unload from it equipment, includingammunition cans, blankets, food containers, and finally a Browning AutomaticRifle.</p><p>Rodr�guez put his arm around Stein&#x2019;s shoulders and pounded his back affectionately,but did not speak.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on, Sergeant Major?&#x201d; Stein asked in Spanish.</p><p>Their relationship was delicate. Rodr�guez had a long service history and hadheld the senior enlisted rank for ten years of it. He knew that Stein had just beenpromoted to staff sergeant yet had been in the army not even two years. </p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Don Cletus Frade had made it clear to Rodr�guez thatStein was in charge of the Froggers and Casa Chica.</p><p>&#x201c;I have had a telephone call from an old friend,&#x201d; Enrico Rodr�guez said.</p><p>&#x201c;There are two trucks of Mountain Troops on their way here. They have withthem a half-dozen Nazi soldiers&#x2014;the ones who came off the submarine? Theones with the skulls on their caps?&#x201d;</p><p>Stein nodded his understanding.</p><p>&#x201c;What makes you think they&#x2019;re coming here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My friend, he is also of the H�sares, heard the Nazi officer tell his men theywere going after traitors to the F�hrer.&#x201d;</p><p>He mispronounced the title, and without thinking about it, Stein correctedhim and then asked, &#x201c;How would they know we have the Froggers here?&#x201d;Rodr�guez shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;We will defend them,&#x201d; Rodr�guez said seriously.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what those guys are for?&#x201d; Stein asked, nodding down the stairs towardthe peones now milling around on the landing strip.</p><p>&#x201c;There are twelve, all old H�sares,&#x201d; Rodr�guez said.</p><p>&#x201c;Sergeant Major, with the twelve we have here, that&#x2019;s two dozen. Againsthow many soldiers on two trucks?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Probably forty, forty-two,&#x201d; Rodr�guez said. &#x201c;What I have been thinking isthat they are coming in such strength thinking we have only the dozen men,and they can make us give them the Froggers without a fight. If they see we areso many, they may decide that there will be a fight, and they know that if thereis a fight against us, there would be many casualties. How would they explainthe deaths of ten or fifteen Mountain Troops so far from their base?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sergeant Major, I think it would be best if there were no confrontation,&#x201d;Stein said carefully.</p><p>&#x201c;You mean just turn the Froggers over to them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. I mean get the Froggers out of here, back to someplace on EstanciaSan Pedro y San Pablo.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don Cletus said they were to be kept here in Casa Chica,&#x201d; Rodr�guez said.</p><p>&#x201c;That was before he knew about this,&#x201d; Stein argued.</p><p>After a pause, the old soldier said, &#x201c;True.&#x201d;</p><p>Stein had to suppress a smile, both at the old soldier and at the Christianscripture that had for some inexplicable reason popped into his Jewish head:<i>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.Ninety seconds ago</i>, he reminded himself, <i>I was asking myself whether I hadthe balls to shoot both of those goddamn Nazis rather than see them freed, and decidedthat I did.</i></p><p>&#x201c;You have some place to take them?&#x201d; Stein pursued.</p><p>&#x201c;I will tell the driver where to take you,&#x201d; Rodr�guez said. &#x201c;And then latermeet you there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to take them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am going to stay here and see what these bastards are up to,&#x201d; Rodr�guez said.</p><p>&#x201c;And so will I,&#x201d; Stein said, somewhat astonished to hear himself say it.</p><p>Rodr�guez was visibly unhappy to hear this.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have a saying in the U.S. Army that there can only be onecommander?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sergeant Major, I recognize that your experience in matters like these ismuch greater than mine.&#x201d; <i>Which is practically nonexistent</i>. &#x201c;I am at your orders.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We will send six of the men, plus the driver, with the Froggers,&#x201d; Rodr�guezordered as he assumed command. &#x201c;You tell The Other Dorotea to prepare theNazis to be moved. Tell her I said I want them tied and blindfolded.&#x201d;</p><p>Stein managed to keep himself from saying, <i>Yes, sir</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;And while you&#x2019;re doing that, I will have the Ford car and your vehiclesmoved over there,&#x201d; he said, pointing to a line of hills that began a quarter of amile the other side of the road. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a dirt road. I want nothing in the housewhen they get here.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Why? What&#x2019;s that all about?</i></p><p>&#x201c;Good idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I will set up my command post there,&#x201d; Rodr�guez said, pointing.</p><p>&#x201c;Just below the military crest of the hill.&#x201d;</p><p><i>What the hell is &#x201c;the military crest of the hill&#x201d;?</i></p><p>Stein nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;And you have the little German camera Don Cletus brought from Brazil?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Leica,&#x201d; Stein said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s in the house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We will need photos of everything that happens here to show Don Cletuswhen he returns. You would be useful doing that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll send two men with you down there,&#x201d; Rodr�guez said, pointing to a roofless,windowless old building on the edge of the road about a hundred meters fromthe gate. &#x201c;I think you will be able to see both the house and the approaches, aswell as the road, from the upper story.&#x201d; He paused and chuckled. &#x201c;If there still isa second story. If not, you&#x2019;ll have to do as best you can from the ground floor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Understood.&#x201d;</p><p><i>While I am trying to take their pictures from the ground floor of a decrepit oldbuilding in the middle of Argentina, I am going to be shot to death by the SS.Jesus Christ!</i></p><p>Thirty minutes later, on the second floor of the old building, Staff SergeantStein sat patiently while one of the two old H�sares with him carefully paintedhis face, his hands, and whatever shiny parts of the Leica Ic camera with a mixtureof dust from the building and axle grease. They took extra care with thecamera so as not to render it useless.</p><p>When they had finished that, they draped Stein in a sort of shroud made from burlap potato bags, which covered his head and his body to his ankles.</p><p>Then, very carefully, they stuck a great deal of dead leafy vegetable matter intothe burlap shroud.</p><p>While he had been undergoing the transformation, the other old H�sar tookapart an Argentine copy of a U.S. Army EE-8 field telephone, disconnected thebells that would ring when another EE-8 was cranked, and then carefully putthe phone back together.</p><p>Then he communicated with four other old H�sares, plus SuboficialMayor Enrico Rodr�guez, who had apparently stationed themselves in placesStein could not see, although he tried very hard.</p><p>And finally, they painted each other&#x2019;s faces with the axle grease and dustcompound, put on potato sack shrouds, and adorned these with dead leafyvegetation. One of them had a Mauser army rifle with a telescopic sight, andthe other a Thompson submachine gun like Stein&#x2019;s. They wrapped them withburlap, looked around, and then wrapped Stein&#x2019;s Thompson in burlap.</p><p>Twenty minutes after that, the man who had camouflaged Stein had a conversationover the telephone, which surprised Stein since he had not heard it ring,although he was no more than four feet from it. Then he remembered watchingthe man disconnect the bell.</p><p>&#x201c;Ten minutes, give or take,&#x201d; the old H�sar said conversationally.</p><p>The first vehicle to appear, five or six minutes later, was not the army truckStein expected from the west but a glistening, if olive-drab, Mercedes-Benzconvertible sedan.

Yogananda emphasized the underlying unity of the world&#39;s great religions, and taught universally applicable methods for attaining direct personal experience of God. To serious students of his teachings he introduced the soul-awakening techniques of Kriya Yoga, a sacred spiritual science originating millenniums ago in India, which had been lost in the Dark Ages and revived in modern times by his lineage of enlightened masters. Among those who became his students were many prominent figures in science, business, and the arts, including horticulturist Luther Burbank, operatic soprano Amelita Galli-Curci, George Eastman (inventor of the Kodak camera), poet Edwin Markham, and symphony conductor Leopold Stokowski. In 1927, he was officially received at the White House by President Calvin Coolidge, who had become interested in the newspaper reports of his activities. In the hundred years since the birth of Paramahansa Yogananda, this world teacher has come to be recognized as one of the greatest emissaries to the West of India&#39;s ancient wisdom. His life and teachings continue to be a source of light and inspiration to people of all races, cultures and creeds.</p><p></p><h2>Lucy&#39;s Summer</h2><p>Former Poet Laureate Donald Hall grew up spending his summers on his grandfather Keniston&#39;s farm in what was then rural New Hampshire. It was there that his mother, Lucy, and her sister Caroline, had grown up, milking cows, raising sheep and telling stories about their childhood - a time when the July Fourth parade in Danbury was the biggest celebration of the year (complete with flags, speeches and ice cream) and when a trip to Boston, where toys could be bought for a penny apiece, was counted as a major event. Published in the same format and with the same delightful hand-colored scratchboard illustrations by Michael McCurdy as Lucy&#39;s Christmas, this is a piece of Americana that will bring readers back to a simpler and gentler America in which pleasure was derived from making as much as buying, and worth was determined by character, not price.</p><p>Donald Hall was appointed the Library of Congress's fourteenth Poet Laureate in June of 2006. He lives in Danbury, New Hampshire, in the house where his mother was born. <br><br>Michael McCurdy's wood engravings and drawings are found in trade books for both adults and children and in fine limited editions. More than two hundred books currently contain his illustrations.Hall and McCurdy's second book about the author's mother's New Hampshire childhood (following Lucy's Christmas) presents itself like a turn-of-the century magic-lantern show, filled with lovingly chronicled moments. Their nostalgic evocations focus on Lucy during the summer of 1910, when "her mother turned the front parlor into a millinery shop"; when she and her sister help preserve food for the winter (the peas alone fill "ten quarts and twenty pints!"); when Lucy rides the Peanut express to Boston. Hall recreates Lucy's sense of awe with his elegant yet homey imagery: the branches of a willow tree "sweep to the ground like a lady's skirt"; peas "clatter into the bottom of the kettle like hail pounding on the roof." Perfectly suited to the poetic text, McCurdy's captivating, finely etched scratchboard illustrations include such period touches as horse-drawn wagons and porcelain dolls' faces. There is little plot here, but the fond recollections of each vignette resonate with certain charm.

In this story the cat and his superior cousin, Percy, attend a fair, where Ralph discovers that although practice is boring, those who practice do better, and those who are above such trivial matters do worse. Author Gantos takes great pleasure in reading his own story, and, though his characters' voices all sound a bit similar, their zesty, telling dialogue distinguishes them quite well. Listeners will enjoy the bright cartoon illustrations of the accompanying book. An added attraction is the festive carnival music that weaves in and out of the production, along with sound effects that suggest the fun of different fairground games. J.C.G. � AudioFile 2007, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Archie Vol. 1</h2><p>ARCHIE, one of the longest-running titles in comic book history, is rebooted here in this full-color collection that brings together two of the most talented creators in comics, Mark Waid and Fiona Staples. Together they create a surprising and definitive take on Archie&#39;s origin--a story that has never been told. The book will captures the bite and hilarious edge of Archie&#39;s original tales in a modern, forward-looking manner, while still retaining the character&#39;s all-ages appeal. If classic Archie is a Saturday morning cartoon, this new series is prime time!</p><p>MARK WAID is an Eisner Award-winning American comic book writer. He is well known for his eight-year run as writer of the DC Comics' title THE FLASH, as well as his scripting of the limited series KINGDOM COME and SUPERMAN: BIRTHRIGHT, and his work on Marvel Comics' CAPTAIN AMERICA. Waid also served as Editor-in-Chief, and later, Chief Creative Officer of BOOM! Studios, where he wrote titles such as IRREDEEMABLE, INCORRUPTIBLE and THE TRAVELER. He has received recent acclaim for his work on the DAREDEVIL and INDESTRUCTIBLE HULK series for Marvel in 2012-2013.<br><br>FIONA STAPLES is a Canadian comic book artist known for her work on books such as SAGA, NORTH 40, DV8: GODS AND MONSTERS, T.H.U.N.D.E.R. AGENTS and the new ARCHIE relaunch. She has been cited as one of the best artists working in the industry.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;Archie Andrews and the Riverdale teens have been reimagined by Eisner Award-winning writer Waid and "Saga" artist Staples with a fresh, 21st-century spin in time for the franchise's 75th anniversary. While still keeping the boy-next-door charm and sweet sensibility of the original comics, this volume, which collects the first six issues of the new iteration, has a more modern twist. Blonde Betty is a baseball-slugging, down-to-earth car mechanic; Archie is a hapless but cool, guitar-playing teen with a streak of bad luck; and new girl Veronica Lodge is a sleek reality TV alum with a knack for dating boys whom her rich father wouldn't approve of. School dances, breakups, mean boys, gossip, and, of course, love triangles make up some of the drama that peppers each issue. Flashbacks and backstory for each character are presented, so readers new to the series won't feel lost. The art, with contributions by Wu and Fish, reflects the modern vibe of this redesign, complete with edgy but somehow timeless clothing; diverse secondary characters, including Betty's multiple love interests; and a gem-toned palette that lets this comic pop off the shelves. The humorous narrative especially makes the philosophical Jughead, who seems to be teeming with ennui, crackle on every page he appears. Variant covers are featured throughout, and a preview of a Jughead-focused comic is appended. VERDICT Archie is reborn, and fans and new readers alike will be clamoring for more.&#x2014;Shelley Diaz, School Library Journal</p><h2>Data and Reality: A Timeless Perspective on Perceiving and Managing Information in Our Imprecise World, 3rd Edition</h2><p>Let's step back to the year 1978. Sony introduces hip portable music with the Walkman, Illinois Bell Company releases the first mobile phone, Space Invaders kicks off the video game craze, and William Kent writes <strong><em>Data and Reality</em></strong>. We have made amazing progress in the last four decades in terms of portable music, mobile communication, and entertainment, making devices such as the original Sony Walkman and suitcase-sized mobile phones museum pieces today. Yet remarkably, the book <strong><em>Data and Reality</em></strong> is just as relevant to the field of data management today as it was in 1978. <p><strong><em>Data and Reality</em></strong> gracefully weaves the disciplines of psychology and philosophy with data management to create timeless takeaways on how we perceive and manage information. Although databases and related technology have come a long way since 1978, the process of eliciting business requirements and how we think about information remains constant. This book will provide valuable insights whether you are a 1970s data-processing expert or a modern-day business analyst, data modeler, database administrator, or data architect.</p><p>This third edition of <strong><em>Data and Reality</em></strong> differs substantially from the first and second editions. Data modeling thought leader Steve Hoberman has updated many of the original examples and references and added his commentary throughout the book, including key points at the end of each chapter. </p><p>The important takeaways in this book are rich with insight yet presented in a conversational writing style. Here are just a few of the issues this book tackles:</p><ul><li>Has "business intelligence" replaced "artificial intelligence"?</li><li>Why is a map's geographic landscape analogous to a data model's information landscape?</li><li>Where do forward and reverse engineering fit in our thought process?</li><li>Why are we all becoming "data archeologists"?</li><li>What causes the communication chasm between the business professional and the information technology professional, and how can the logical data model bridge this gap?</li><li>Why do we invest in hardware and software to solve business problems before determining what the business problems are in the first place?</li><li>What is the difference between oneness, sameness, and categories?</li><li>Why does context play a role in every design decision?</li><li>Why do the more important attributes become entities or relationships?</li><li>Why do symbols speak louder than words?</li><li>What's the difference between a data modeler, a philosopher, and an artist?</li><li>Why is the 1975 dream of mapping all attributes still a dream today?</li><li>What influence does language have on our perception of reality? </li><li>Can we distinguish between naming and describing?</li></ul><p><b>From Graeme Simsion's foreword:</b><br><i>While such fundamental issues remain unrecognized and unanswered, <strong>Data and Reality</strong>, with its lucid and compelling elucidation of the questions, needs to remain in print.

Author of <strong><em>Data and Reality</em></strong>, he wrote scores of papers and spoke at conferences worldwide, posing questions about database design and the management of information that remain unanswered today. Though he earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering and a master's in mathematics, he had no formal training in computer science. Kent worked at IBM and later at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, where he helped develop prototype database systems. He also served on or chaired several international standards committees.

Traditionally, we have also learned formal reasoning by studying Euclidean geometry. In this book, David Clark develops a modern axiomatic approach to this ancient subject, both in content and presentation. Mathematically, Clark has chosen a new set of axioms that draw on a modern understanding of set theory and logic, the real number continuum and measure theory, none of which were available in Euclid&#39;s time. The result is a development of the standard content of Euclidean geometry with the mathematical precision of Hilbert&#39;s foundations of geometry. In particular, the book covers all the topics listed in the Common Core State Standards for high school synthetic geometry. The presentation uses a guided inquiry, active learning pedagogy. Students benefit from the axiomatic development because they themselves solve the problems and prove the theorems with the instructor serving as a guide and mentor. Students are thereby empowered with the knowledge that they can solve problems on their own without reference to authority. This book, written for an undergraduate axiomatic geometry course, is particularly well suited for future secondary school teachers. In the interest of fostering a greater awareness and appreciation of mathematics and its connections to other disciplines and everyday life, MSRI and the AMS are publishing books in the Mathematical Circles Library series as a service to young people, their parents and teachers, and the mathematics profession.</p><p>David M. Clark is at State University of New York, NY, USA.An interesting and singular approach of the Euclidean geometry is contained in this book . . . [The] book covers all the topics listed in the common core state standards for high school synthetic geometry . . . [T]he didactical approach of the large collection of problems, solutions and geometrical constructions is very important to consider it as a good textbook for teaching and learning synthetic geometry. --Mauro Garcia Pupo, Zentralblatt MATH</p><h2>An Introduction to Young Children With Special Needs: Birth Through Age Eight</h2><p><strong>An Introduction to Young Children with Special Needs: Birth Through Age Eight</strong> is a comprehensive introduction to educational policies, programs, practices, and services for future practitioners serving young children with delays or disabilities in early intervention-early childhood special education (EI-ECSE).

She lives in the UK.Prologue<br> At the beginning<br> On the shore <br><br>The storm was shattering. <br><br>Lightning struck a tree. The trunk split with extraordinary violence, but there was an inevitability to its destruction. <br><br>So, too, with her. As she was sundered in two, there was no surprise&#x2014;only pain. <br><br>She heard herself crack, the ichor in her veins boiling, but then all noise was drowned out by the roar of the storm. In days past she had summoned lightning at a thought; the rain came and went at her command; the waves churned at her whim. <br><br>But those powers had been taken from her. Now it was she who was at the mercy of the elements, tossed about like a toy. She fought to hold on to the broken parts of herself, but they slipped out of her grasp. <br><br>Insensibility seized her. She was dragged down into darkness, not grateful, and yet relieved. <br><br>When she opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was the dark bowl of the night sky. <br>Faint stars were scattered across its curved surface, and a full white moon rode the clouds. The air smelt sweetly of rain, but the tempest had passed. <br><br>Now a hush held the world in the palm of its hand. A low voice rumbled through her bones, monotonous and familiar. It was the voice of the waves, running up the shore and receding. <br><br>She felt as if she had awakened after a deep, revivifying sleep. She could not remember what had happened before, but that she had suffered she did not doubt. All distress had passed with the storm, however. She felt pleasantly empty&#x2014;weak, wrung out, but calm. <br><br>The sand whispered against her as she rose unsteadily to her feet. Before her was the sea. Behind her, the dark mass of the jungle loomed out of the night like a drowsing beast, only half-asleep. <br><br>She felt her way across the shore, going slowly, for her limbs felt new to her. The beach was scattered with the debris of the storm, and she tripped on a piece of wood, grazing her knee. <br><br>The silence of the world began to frighten her. She felt alone, abandoned by all she had known&#x2014;even her own self, for she could not remember what she was called. Trees lined the shore, graceful assemblies of coconut palms and casuarinas. But when she addressed them, they did not answer. <br><br>She longed for a friendly voice, the touch of a hand she knew. She had been asleep for so long. If only someone would tell her what had happened&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <br><br>Her foot knocked against something solid. This log seemed different&#x2014;solid, but more yielding. She crouched down, reaching out, and felt warm flesh, the jutting edge of bone. The body was breathing. It stirred at her touch. <br><br>The girl opened her eyes. They gleamed as they caught the light of the moon, and they held the same look she must have on her own face&#x2014;a look of recognition and relief. &#x201c;Muna.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Is that my name?&#x201d; said Muna, but she was not really questioning it. She had known at once that they belonged to each other. &#x201c;I have forgotten yours.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I was called Sakti, I think,&#x201d; said the other. &#x201c;Help me up, kak,&#x201d; she said, calling Muna &#x2018;&#x201c;sister,&#x201d;&#x2018; and from then on that was how they addressed each other. <br><br>Chapter 1 <br>Six weeks later<br><br>The island of Janda Baik, the Straits of Malacca<br><br>Muna<br><br>The forests of Janda Baik were imposing even in the full glare of daylight. In the half-light of dawn they were something else altogether-an extrusion of another, inhuman world, beyond terror or awe.<br><br>The forests blanketed a large part of the island, but the villages clung to the coast. The people of the island went quietly in the shadow of the jungle, avoiding its notice. What came to pass in the jungle was the business of witches and spirits.<br><br>Of course, such business was precisely Mak Genggang's stock-in-trade. In appearance she was like any aged village woman to be found bent over cooking pots in a kitchen or selling vegetables in a market. Her manner, which combined warmth with an imperiousness that would not have been out of place in a palace, would not distinguish her from any other matriarch in her batik cloths.<br><br>Yet her appearance was deceptive. As everyone in Janda Baik knew, Mak Genggang was the foremost witch of the region, first among the magicians in the polities along the Straits. The King of Siam himself was said to have sought her counsel; she was renowned among practitioners of the magic arts in China and India; and she counted among her friends England's Sorceress Royal, who presided over the magicians of that distant country. Mak Genggang's name was known even in the Unseen Realm-the hidden world where the spirits live, next door to our own.<br><br>Despite her great powers she was a kindly woman, but as with many strong people who are not often afraid, it did not come naturally to her to take thought of the fears of the weak. It had been she who insisted that Muna and her sister Sakti depart at the start of the day, before the sun had quite risen.<br><br>"Magic is always strongest at a border," the witch had explained. "Whether it be between jungle and village, or earth and sea, or day and night."<br><br>Sakti's face had twitched. Muna had known just how she felt. Left to herself, Muna would not have set off any earlier than noon, when the sun would be high in the sky, its light inescapable.<br><br>"We will be guided by your judgment, of course, mak cik," Muna said. "But will not it be easier for us to see our way if we leave later in the day?"<br><br>"The sooner you are off, the better," said the witch firmly.<br><br>They had risen at dawn, when it was dark, and the sky was still a deep blue when they arrived at the edge of the jungle. Under the trees lay a shadowy world, full of mystery and discomfort-leeches, snakes, dangerous beasts . . . and magic. For through the jungle lay the shortest route to the Unseen Realm, the abode of djinns and spirits, whence all magic ultimately flowed.<br><br>"If we put you on a ship to England, it would be a year before you saw its shores," said Mak Genggang. "But the Unseen Realm borders all mortal lands, and it will take you no time at all to get there through the jungle. Any fool who wanders in the forest risks stumbling into the world of the spirits, if he does not take care."<br><br>Muna had heard all the usual stories of such fools, and the grisly ends to which they came. The tales were not such as to light in her any flame of desire to model herself on their heroes. "But is it safe to go this way, mak cik?"<br><br>"Of course it is not safe," said Mak Genggang impatiently. "But it would not be safe for you to remain here either. I shall make a path for you, and if you walk briskly, you will be in England before the Sorceress Royal has sat down to her breakfast."<br><br>The ceremony for the opening of the path was a simple one. Mak Genggang did not chant, nor work any great magic, so far as Muna could tell. She merely bowed her head, muttering and prodding the grass with a stick, as though she were searching for something she had lost.<br><br>Muna drew her shawl closer around her, shivering at the chill morning air. There must be more to the witch's activities than was apparent to unmagical eyes, for Sakti watched Mak Genggang with interest, seeming to forget her apprehension at the journey ahead.<br><br>There were only three of them at the forest's edge. No one else in Mak Genggang's household had been told of their departure. Of course Muna saw the need for discretion-it was no one's fault but their own that they were being sent away in secret.<br><br>Yet she regretted that she could not bid everyone good-bye. Like most persons of importance Mak Genggang boasted a numerous following, though hers was more variegated than was usual. In her substantial wooden house, set back from the rest of the village, resided a shifting population of witches, apprentices, servants, slaves, bondswomen, poor relations, strays of all descriptions and even a number of lamiae.<br><br>These last had alarmed Muna when she had first joined the witch's household, but use had accustomed her to them. They were not unlike mortal females-which was perhaps not surprising, for lamiae are nothing more than the spectres of women who die nursing a great grievance. The chief point that distinguished them from other women was their predilection for consuming the vitals of humans; they were particularly fond of infants. Those who lived under Mak Genggang's protection were tame, however, observing strict codes of proper behaviour. They were inordinately fond of gossip and prone to quarrelling among themselves-but these were foibles shared by most of the witch's dependents.<br><br>Yet Muna had grown attached to her fellow servants in the weeks since Mak Genggang had found her and Sakti wandering confused upon the shore, and taken them under her protection. Muna thought wistfully of the girl who slept on the pallet next to hers. She had often wished Puteh would not insist on repeating her conversations with a certain well-favoured youth in the village when Muna wished to sleep, but now she would miss that excitable voice buzzing in her ear. And she would miss Kak Lena, who reigned over Mak Genggang's kitchen. She had promised to teach Muna Mak Genggang's recipe for sambal (a secret as jealously guarded as any of the witch's magic spells), but Muna would never learn it now . . . <br><br>"Why do you sniff?" whispered Sakti, with what for her was unusual percipience.<br><br>"It is nothing," said Muna, embarrassed. She flicked her tears away with her shawl. "Only-I was thinking of everyone, you know! Aren't you sorry to leave, adik?"<br><br>"No," said Sakti. "You know I have been longing for something to happen!"<br><br>Muna sighed, but she had not really expected any other response from Sakti. She did not doubt they were sisters: how else could Sakti have known her name the moment they woke, though they remembered nothing else of their past lives? Certainly they looked alike-though Sakti was the prettier, with larger eyes, longer lashes and a clearer golden skin-but they seemed to share no other point of resemblance.<br><br>It was supposed they had been lost at sea during the storm-such a storm as Janda Baik had not seen in living memory, devastating crops and drowning several fishermen. But neither Muna nor Sakti could say what village they were from, nor name their family.<br><br>"The shock has chased these things out of your mind," Mak Genggang had said, "but you will remember in time and then we will find your people."<br><br>But they did not remember, though the days passed, turning insensibly into weeks.<br><br>The lapse of time had not worried Muna. It was inconvenient not to have memories, to be sure-yet life under Mak Genggang's protection was comfortable. Muna had been set to work in the kitchen, and since in the witch's household the art of cookery was as highly developed and esteemed as that of magic, she had found the work of absorbing interest. She had made friends among her fellow servants, and rapidly become part of the life of the house.<br><br>As for her sister, Sakti had been singled out by Mak Genggang from the outset for her remarkable magical gift. She had been elevated to the rank of apprentice and relieved of the greater part of her domestic duties so that she might devote her time to the study of magic.<br><br>Muna herself lacked any magical facility, but she was not exercised by this. Magic hardly seemed to make Sakti happy. To be admitted to Mak Genggang's lessons in magic was accounted a great honour-noblemen and princesses had eagerly sought the privilege-but Sakti did not value her good fortune as she ought. Hers was a restless temperament and she chafed under the burden of Mak Genggang's authority.<br><br>"The old woman is a tyrant!" she said to Muna. "I don't see how you can bring yourself to bow and scrape to her, and say yes, mak cik and no, mak cik as you do."<br><br>The truth was that Muna was fond of Mak Genggang. The witch could be overbearing, but it was natural that one so old and powerful should believe she knew what was best. But to say this to Sakti would only annoy her.<br><br>"I find that the fact she is a powerful magician is a great incentive to courtesy," said Muna mildly. "Besides, we are indebted to her. She was under no obligation to take us in."<br><br>Sakti could not deny that the witch had been kind. Mak Genggang had shown no impatience for their departure, as the time passed and they remained at her household. As for Muna, she knew there must be people wondering at their disappearance-family and friends waiting for their return-but since she could not remember them, she felt no urgent need of a reunion. She should happily have remained with Mak Genggang indefinitely . . . if not for the curse.<br><br>She glanced at Sakti's waist, but the evidence of the curse was concealed by Sakti's sarong. The recollection of the wound made Muna soften towards her sister. Why should Sakti regret to leave a place that had served her so ill? Muna could only hope that England would suit her better.<br><br>Mak Genggang straightened, tossing her stick away and clapping her hands. "There! That will keep you as safe as you can hope to be in djinn-country. And I have laid speech-magic on each of you, so you ought not to have any difficulty speaking with the English."<br><br>The path unfurled before their feet: a silver rope of light, winding across the grass and into the jungle. Sakti and Muna regarded it in some doubt. Mak Genggang's businesslike manner did not quite suffice to persuade them that to stroll into the Unseen World was nothing out of the ordinary way.<br><br>"What shall we do if we encounter any spirits?" ventured Sakti.<br><br>"I have taught you spells for defence. You will not have forgot them all, surely?" said Mak Genggang.<br><br>"No, but-"<br><br>"You should not have need of them in any event, so long as you keep to the path. Few spirits will offer to molest you if they know you are under my protection," said Mak Genggang. "You must be discreet, however. The Queen of the Djinns has never minded what we do here in Janda Baik, but she has quarrelled with the English, and that has made her particular about who may travel between her realm and England. But if you are quick and quiet there is no reason she should ever know you have passed through her lands.<br><br>"You had best get along," she added, when Muna and Sakti still evinced an inclination to linger. "I have other business to attend to-and we don't want the English to come and find you still here. It would be just like their wickedness to surprise us! Go in safety, and give my regards to the Sorceress Royal and her young man. And mind you look after your sister!"<br><br>It would have been natural for the witch to have been addressing Sakti, since it was Sakti who had magic and was best equipped to defend them against the various perils of the Unseen. Yet Mak Genggang looked at Muna.<br><br>"I shall watch over my sister, mak cik," said Muna. She hesitated. "Thank you. You have been very good to us!"<br><br>They set off. Muna did not mean to look back, for she had a suspicion she would disgrace herself if she did. Yet she turned despite herself.<br><br>Though they had only advanced a dozen steps into the jungle, already the crowding trees obscured her view. Through the gaps between the boles, she caught a glimpse of the witch still standing there-a small, upright figure, deceptively frail, shading her eyes with one hand.</p><h2>Die Fledermaus: Vocal Score (G.
